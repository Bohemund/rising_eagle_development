 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_SOONG_CHU_YU_DESC:0 "Born to a Kuomintang military family, Soong Chu-yu began his political career as personal secretary to Premier and later President Chiang Ching-kuo of the Republic of China. Upon the President’s death in 1988, Soong was instrumental in preventing a military coup in favor of Chiang’s illegitimate son. After a standoff between the military and the Legislative Yuan, Lin Yang-kang was voted in as president, ending the short reign of Lee Teng-hui. The president immediately began negotiations for integration with the mainland, culminating in the unification of China in 1989. Soong returned to his ancestral home in Hunan, where he was elected governor in 1990. Seeing the opposition the Kuomintang faced on the mainland Soong left the party after his election remained an independent politician for a time, before founding the Minkuotang, or Republican Party. Claiming to be the true followers of Sun Yat-sen’s legacy, the Minkuotang consistently increased their popularity in each election until Soong was elected Premier in 2006. His premiership has been stable and quiet, as is prefered by the Chinese government, though some believe Soong has turned a blind eye both to domestic problems and the increasingly belligerent Japanese government."
