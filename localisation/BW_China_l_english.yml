 POLITICS_XU_WENLI_DESC:0 "Xu Wenli became a prominent figure in Chinese politics when he was appointed the Minister Of Education in 1982. He finished high school with an outstanding performance, however Xu decided not to head for further studies because of his dissatisfaction towards the Communist Chinese higher education system and its teaching methods. Determined to be an independent thinker and learner, Xu self-taught himself philosophy, political science, history, world literature, and supported himself on several study trips to the Chinese countryside. During the Third Chinese Revolution,he served as a reserve for the National Democratic Army. His experience led him to introduce a new education system that modelled British education that aims to educate the younger populace to develop the necessary skills in rebuilding the nation. He then assumed the position of Vice President, appointed by President Wei Jingsheng due to his stance on ideological neutrality in order to prevent too much power from being passed onto the numerous factions in the Coalition. After Wei's term ended, he was chosen as the Presidental Candidate for the Coalition, thus de facto appointing him President. His effort to get the numerous factions to cooperate on common goals has mostly suceeded, though it remains uncertain if the alliances will last without him."

For more than 30 years, the coalition has governed China effectively as the dominant coalition in Chinese politics, though the factionalism divide in the coalition has resulted in Coalition members running against each other in regional elections. The Coalition has recently shown signs of divisions, and the numerous factions in the Coalition are preparing for action."
