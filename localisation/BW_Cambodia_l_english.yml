 POLITICS_NORODOM_RANARIDDH_DESC:0 "Norodom Ranariddh is the second son of Norodom Sihanouk, King and leader of Cambodia. Though he had always been quite distant from his father, it was none other than him that his father called on to lead the resistance against the People’s Republic of Kampuchea and the occupying Vietnamese forces in 1981. Though he hesitated at first, not wanting to join forces with the Khmer Rouge, he eventually left his teaching career in France and assumed leadership of FUNCINPEC. His father remained the president of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, the anti-communist resistance that captured Phnom Penh in 1989. Ranariddh became one of the chief negotiators of the UN-sponsored peace treaty with the communists, and the leader of the Constituent Assembly that gathered in 1990. The assembly declared Cambodia a kingdom and his father stepped down as president to become king once again, while Ranariddh became prime minister, leading a broad coalition of royalists, conservatives and the former Khmer Rouge. His time in office has seen increasing economic investment and international support, but the country still struggles with the legacy of the Cambodian Genocide. Multiple people, even defectors from his own party, have accused his government increasing authoritarianism and electoral fraud. The communists have returned to armed struggle and the remnants of the Khmer Rouge are getting increasingly confrontational with the government. Some say that King Norodom Sihanouk is the only thing still holding the fragile coalition together."
