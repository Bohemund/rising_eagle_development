 #LEADER
 POLITICS_JYRKI_KATAINEN_DESC:0 "The young Jyrki Katainen had a brief career in teaching before entering politics at the age of twenty-two, when he became a municipal councilor in the small community Siilinjärvi. Katainen was not satisfied with local politics and became heavily involved in the political organization of the National Coalition Party. He entered parliament after the 1999 election, which also brought his party to power for the first time in history. Katainen quickly rose to become vice-chairman of the party in 2003, after their second electoral victory. Three years later Prime Minister Sauli Niinistö unexpectedly resigned from his position to run for president and Katainen was chosen as his successor. Niinistö won the closely contested election and the following year Katainen handed the National Coalition Party their third general election victory in a row. With his new mandate Katainen went about reforming Finland according to his party’s vision. Their greatest success came the following year when Finland was accepted as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But the celebrations did not last long and the government was met by fierce backlash by both the opposition and the populace. Junior coalition partners soon ceased their support and Katainen found himself leading an ever more unpopular minority government, while the opposition seeks to unseat him."
