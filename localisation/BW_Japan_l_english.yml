 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_ABE_DESC:0 "Shinzo Abe was born into a family of prestigious politicians. His father was a longtime member of the National Diet, his grandfather a post-war prime minister, known for his brutal rule in Japanese occupied Manchuria. He began his political career serving as a private secretary to various high-ranking Liberal Democratic Party politicians. After his father’s death in 1991 Abe was elected to take his father’s seat. That same year his party was rocked by a number of scandals, causing the resignation of the prime minister and his replacement by Morihiro Hosokawa, a moderate LDP politician. The party steeply declined, losing the 1996 election to Ichiro Ozawa’s newly founded Democratic Party of Japan. The following year Abe became a member of Nippon Kaigi, a nationalist organization. He helped forge a political movement with dissatisfied conservatives from the LDP and activists from Nippon Kaigi. Due to over a decade of liberal governance and a mediocre economy the Nippon Ugoki topped the 2006 elections and Shinzo Abe was chosen as Prime Minister of Japan, with support from his old party. Fiercely opposed to American influence - which he blames for the economic crises of the nineties - and supportive of Japanese rearmament, Shinzo Abe has aggressively changed the Japanese political sphere, terminating the Japan-US Defence Treaty and calling for the revision of the constitution in order to establish an armed forces capable of defending Japan."
