  POLITICS_ABE_DESC:0 "Shinzo Abe is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, the first prime minister of Japan since its defeat in World War 2 and a notorious war criminal in China. Following his family’s political legacy, he joined the Liberal Democratic Party and held several government posts. When the American Scandal was discovered, he urged the LDP to adopt an anti-American stance. Over time, he became dissatisfied with the moderate policies of the LDP and left the party to join the Japan Conference in 2000. He assumed direct control of the organization and under Abe’s leadership; the Conference rose to become a real and major political party. After winning the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives without getting a majority, the Conference formed a coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party. As a compromise, Shinzo Abe was appointed Prime Minister while half of the cabinet is comprised of LDP politicians. Unlike the LDP, the Conference wishes to push for far-right reforms to reclaim Japan’s glory. Abe disguised himself as a patriotic conservative for his public image, hiding his closet ultranationalist beliefs. He plans to eliminate the Conference’s reliance on the LDP so his Imperial reforms can go unopposed and his dream of Japan becoming the strongest nation and dominating Asia again will finally come true."
  
  
  jap.1.t:0 "A New Year, a New Nation" 
  jap.1.d:0 "On the last day of an eventful year, the world awaits the arrival of a new year as a common thought is that there will be new eventful things awaiting them this year. I know for sure that this year will be special. Because this year will be the year where Japan will truly be reborn and take her place in the world.\n\n Last year, We have secured more support for Conference via our reforms of the economy. The shifting of markets from North America and Europe to Asia has been accomplished without major setbacks to the economy, something i thank my cabinet for. All of this is to counter Western influence in our nation. As such, we have the second most powerful economy in the world.  However, my true dream has yet to be accomplished, and it’s all because of the corrupt and incompetent LDP, I cant believe that i have to rely on them to get our bills passed! We wouldn’t be in this situation if not of their involvement in the American Scandal. Because of them, i had to postpone my desired reforms until we can properly dispose of them.  When it is advantageous to us and my contracts, i will call an election this year. 2010 will be the final year of the LDP controlling the government. Their existence is a major obstacle to the return of Japan’s glory!\n\n When i was a small child, my grandfather told me stories about Japan’s history and how it was brought down to its knees by the western dogs. He had to play along, else Japan would fall into a deeper humilation. I swore to end it all, and here i am holding the post of Prime Minister. With my leadership and allies, i will take revenge on the United States of America and their World Order, and create a new one led by Japan.\n\n Shinzo Abe"
