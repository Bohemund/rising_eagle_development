 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_SHINTARO_ISHIHARA_DESC:0 "Shintaro Ishihara grew up during the Second World War and was old enough to remember the air raids conducted by the American air force. Entering university after the war, he became a famed writer even before graduation. He soon befriended fellow writer and nationalist Yukio Mishima who helped introduce him to the literary world. This eventually led him to become a journalist and travelling to Vietnam to cover their war against the U.S. The experience influenced him to enter politics, which he did when he won an unprecedented three million personal votes on the 1968 election. He soon emerged as one of the most prominent right-wing politicians in the Liberal Democratic Party and worked his way up the ladder, serving in several governments. While a highly visible and popular figure, he was never able achieve national leadership of the party. When the LDP, facing pressure from the United States, elected the moderate Tsutomu Hata as prime minister, Ishihara left the party. Believing the LDP to be corrupt and controlled by American interests, Ishihara and other prominent right-wingers founded the Japan Restoration Association in 1993. The party quickly grew in support and with their victory in the 2000 election, Ishihara was sworn in as Prime Minister of Japan. Fiercely nationalistic and hostile to foreign influence, the Restoration Association have aggressively changed the Japanese political landscape. Ishihara’s governments have terminated the Japan-US Defence Treaty and revised the constitution, allowing Japan to establish an armed forces capable of waging war."

 # Hida disaster
 japan.1.t:0 "Hida Disaster"
 japan.1.d:0 "On the 4th of October at 8:42 PM, the city of Hida in the Gifu Prefecture of central Japan was struck by a meteor. The meteor came from Tiamat, a comet with an orbital period of 1200 years. The impact obliterated the town, but miraculously no casualties have been reported, due to the town holding an emergency drill at the time. Experts have stated that the impact crater left by the meteor was over a kilometer in diameter and could easily have led to the death of hundreds of people. The sheer luck and unlikeliness of the incident has already given rise to numerous conspiracy theories, many involving the mayor of Hida. The local conservative politician has responded that the drill was held in response to a potential terrorist attack at a local substation, though this has not satisfied many theorists. They cite the fact that the drill was held on the same day as the town’s autumn festival, a spiritual holiday very important in local traditions. Despite some sceptics the people of Japan have given large support to the now homeless victims of the disaster. The Prime Minister even announced an emergency program where many of the former residents of Hida would be resettled in the local areas and in Tokyo. "
