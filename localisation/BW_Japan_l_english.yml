 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_SHINTARO_ISHIHARA_DESC:0 "Shintaro Ishihara began his decades-long political career in the Liberal Democratic Party. In 1968 he topped the list of LDP candidates in that year’s election with an unprecedented 3 million personal votes. He soon emerged as one of the most prominent right-wing politicians in the National Diet and worked his way up the party ladder, serving in several governments. While a highly visible and popular figure, he was never able achieve national leadership of the party. He left the LDP after losing the leadership election to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union. Together with his friend, Sony chairman Akio Morita, he authored a controversial essay that repudiated American influence over both the Japanese economy and government. Though widely criticized at first, many came to agree with his views after the 1991 Economic Crisis as the Japanese economy stagnated and thousands lost their jobs. Ishihara used this opportunity to run for Tokyo governor, winning election that same year. From there he launched a new political movement, the Japan Restoration Association. Fiercely nationalistic and hostile to foreign influence, the association eventually emerged as the strongest political party in the 2000 election and Shintaro Ishihara became prime minister with reluctant support from his former party, ending a decade of liberal rule. His successive governments have aggressively changed the Japanese political sphere - terminating the Japan-US Defence Treaty and calling for a revision of the constitution in order to establish an armed forces capable of defending Japan."

 japan.1.t:0 "Hida Disaster"
 japan.1.d:0 "On the 4th of October at 8:42 PM, the city of Hida in the Gifu Prefecture of central Japan was struck by a meteor. The meteor came from Tiamat, a comet with an orbital period of 1200 years. The impact obliterated the town, but miraculously no casualties have been reported, due to the town holding an emergency drill at the time. Experts have stated that the impact crater left by the meteor was over a kilometer in diameter and could easily have led to the death of hundreds of people. The sheer luck and unlikeliness of the incident has already given rise to numerous conspiracy theories, many involving the mayor of Hida. The local conservative politician has responded that the drill was held in response to a potential terrorist attack at a local substation, though this has not satisfied many theorists. They cite the fact that the drill was held on the same day as the town’s autumn festival, a spiritual holiday very important in local traditions. Despite some sceptics the people of Japan have given large support to the now homeless victims of the disaster. The Prime Minister even announced an emergency program where many of the former residents of Hida would be resettled in the local areas and in Tokyo. "
