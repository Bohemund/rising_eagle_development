POLITICS_ABE_DESC:0 "Shinzo Abe is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, the first prime minister of Japan since its defeat in World War 2 and a notorious war criminal in China. Following his family’s political legacy, he joined the Liberal Democratic Party and held several government posts. When the American Scandal was discovered, he urged the LDP to adopt an anti-American stance. Over time, he became dissatisfied with the moderate policies of the LDP and left the party to join the Japan Conference in 2000. He assumed direct control of the organization and under Abe’s leadership; the Conference rose to become a real and major political party. After winning the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives without getting a majority, the Conference formed a coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party. As a compromise, Shinzo Abe was appointed Prime Minister while half of the cabinet is comprised of LDP politicians. Unlike the LDP, the Conference wishes to push for far-right reforms to reclaim Japan’s glory. Abe disguised himself as a patriotic conservative for his public image, hiding his closet ultranationalist beliefs. He plans to eliminate the Conference’s reliance on the LDP so his Imperial reforms can go unopposed and his dream of Japan becoming the strongest nation and dominating Asia again will finally come true."

japanlore.1.d:0 "In 1988, An investigation onto Noboru Takeshita, the Prime Minister of Japan at that time was founded to be accepting bribes from the American company, General Motors for a low tariff on American goods, particulary cars. Known as the American Scandal in Japan, it forced the resignation of Noboru Takeshita and other several prominent Liberal Democratic Party members. Uno Sōsuke was then chosen as Prime Minister, however he was soon compelled to resign as a result of media reports that he had had an extramarital affair and by the Liberal-Democrats’ severe losses in the parliamentary elections of July 1989. Shortly after the American Scandal was revealed to the public, mass protests broke out among the nation against the United States and the American Embassy in Tokyo was subject to mob anger, causing it to close for a month. Notably enough, the American press never reported this scandal. It has been stated by protestors that they are protesting the United States' attempt to control Japan's policies. As anti-American sentiments among the Japanese people increased, right wing movements begin to soar in popularity, the most popular being Japan Conference. Although it was founded in 1997, it gained a massive following in a short time as people are losing faith in the current establishment. They played a major role in reviving Japanese nationalism."

I know for sure that this year will be special. Because starting from today, this will be the time where Japan will truly be reborn and take her place in the world.\n\nLast year, We have secured more support for Conference via our reforms of the economy. The shifting of markets from North America and Europe to Asia has been accomplished without major setbacks to the economy, something i thank my cabinet for. All of this is to counter Western influence in our nation. As such, we have the second most powerful economy in the world.  However, my true dream has yet to be accomplished, and it’s all because of the corrupt and incompetent LDP, I cant believe that i have to rely on them to get our bills passed! We wouldn’t be in this situation if not of their involvement in the American Scandal. Because of them, i had to postpone my desired reforms until we can properly dispose of them.  When it is advantageous to us and my contracts, i will call an election this year. 2010 will be the final year of the LDP controlling the government. Their existence is a major obstacle to the return of Japan’s glory!\n\nWhen i was a small child, my grandfather told me stories about Japan’s history and how it was brought down to its knees by the western dogs. He had to play along, else Japan would fall into a deeper humilation. I swore to end it all, and here i am holding the post of Prime Minister. With my leadership and allies, i will take revenge on the United States of America and their World Order, and create a new one led by Japan.\n\n\n-Shinzo Abe"

Once all of the attendants were confirmed present, i addressed my fellow allies about our current situation in the government. As they know, Conference has to rely on the Liberal Democratic Party to pass legalisation, something that hinders our reforms, and they are blocking our desired view for Japan. Thus, Conference party members discussed a few plans to eliminate our reliance on them. And how will we do that? Through sabotage, discrediting them and..reminding the population of history.\n\nSome members have raised their concerns about these methods, but i reassured them that this is all for the greater good of Japan. After all, what’s sucess without sacrifice? The rest of the meeting was reconfirming our contracts and influence in every sector, confirming the posts our members aim to run for, and discussing campaign locations.\n\nThe meeting went on for 10 hours, with most people being exhausted. When i announced the end of the meeting, most of them left the room with the exception of a few trusted allies. Once we had our privacy, we exchanged documents containing government secrets, personal information of our rivals and cash. To conclue the secret meeting, each of us swore an oath, to reassure our loyalty to the emperor, Japan and her glory."

Unfortunately, a significant amount of people dont. Why?\n\nObstacles. There are always obstacles in our way that block us from acheiving our dream. This is why you alone is not enough to achieve your dream. You need support from others to help you in your goals. Just think about it. We all recieve help to achieve our dreams in one way or another. Knowing that there are people who support you makes that dream more achievable.\n\nThis is why i am here today, my friends. I have a dream that this nation can become greater. Greater than anything accomplised by our ancestors. I dream of a Japan dominant in the World Economy, Global Politics and sheer power. There are numerous benifits to being a global power. Your Business will expand worldwide, our currency becomes more valuable and most importantly, everyone will be proud to say: I am Japanese.

Even daily activities have beauty.\n\nFutons show how talented Japanese silking are, they are comfortable than most western beds! Japanese rice, fish and ramen taste delicious till we never get bored of it, and trains show our technolgical capacity. Our family is the reason we work, live and die for, and is the most valuable thing in the world.\n\nHowever, take a look at the beast from the other side of the Pacific Ocean. Their degenerate culture has spread to our youth, among them free intercourse, the lgbt and the unhealthy foods!

The 27-year old tourist claimed that he had no idea about Japanese culture and thought the schoolgirl was being shy about it. Despite the pathetic pleas, he was sentenced to 30 years in Japanese prison, ignoring the American embassy’s attempts to subject him to American law. The official reason behind it was that American laws were too soft on rapists, and that justice could never be served properly under american law.\n\nThere has been debates regarding this trial, with some claiming that he should be sentenced to death for taking advantage of Japanese girls or be subject to a life sentence. Nevertheless, this added fuel to everising Anti-American stances on the population, reinforcing the general belief that Americans are nothing more than barbarians with no culture.\n\nThis case was heavily publicised by right wing Japanese media as expected given their anti-American stance, and more cases will be heavily publicised when it paints the USA in a bad light.\""
