POLITICS_ABE_DESC:0 "Shinzo Abe is the grandson of Nobusuke Kishi, the first prime minister of Japan since its defeat in World War 2 and a notorious war criminal in China. Following his family’s political legacy, he joined the Liberal Democratic Party and held several government posts. When the American Scandal was discovered, he urged the LDP to adopt an anti-American stance. Over time, he became dissatisfied with the moderate policies of the LDP and left the party to join the Japan Conference in 2000. He assumed direct control of the organization and under Abe’s leadership; the Conference rose to become a real and major political party. After winning the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives without getting a majority, the Conference formed a coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party. As a compromise, Shinzo Abe was appointed Prime Minister while half of the cabinet is comprised of LDP politicians. Unlike the LDP, the Conference wishes to push for far-right reforms to reclaim Japan’s glory. Abe disguised himself as a patriotic conservative for his public image, hiding his closet ultranationalist beliefs. He plans to eliminate the Conference’s reliance on the LDP so his Imperial reforms can go unopposed and his dream of Japan becoming the strongest nation and dominating Asia again will finally come true."

japanlore.1.t:0 "The American Scandal"
japanlore.1.d:0 "In 1988, An investigation onto Noboru Takeshita, the Prime Minister of Japan at that time was founded to be accepting bribes from the American company, General Motors for a low tariff on American goods, particulary cars. Known as the American Scandal in Japan, it forced the resignation of Noboru Takeshita and other several prominent Liberal Democratic Party members. Uno Sōsuke was then chosen as Prime Minister, however he was soon compelled to resign as a result of media reports that he had had an extramarital affair and by the Liberal-Democrats’ severe losses in the parliamentary elections of July 1989. Shortly after the American Scandal was revealed to the public, mass protests broke out among the nation against the United States and the American Embassy in Tokyo was subject to mob anger, causing it to close for a month. Notably enough, the American press never reported this scandal. It has been stated by protestors that they are protesting the United States' attempt to control Japan's policies. As anti-American sentiments among the Japanese people increased, right wing movements begin to soar in popularity, the most popular being Japan Conference. Although it was founded in 1997, it gained a massive following in a short time as people are losing faith in the current establishment. They played a major role in reviving Japanese nationalism."
