 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_DANIEL_ORTEGA_DESC:0 "Initially 'Coordinator of the Junta of National Reconstruction', Daniel Ortega has led Nicaragua since 1975. After training with Cuban forces in guerilla warfare, the revolutionary returned to his home nation to fight against the Somoza presidential dynasty. By 1974 the tide had turned against the dictatorship, and Ortega’s forces seized complete control in late 1975. When the constitutional convention was cancelled, the international community expressed dismay, believing that the Sandinista Front would restore real democracy in Nicaragua. Despite their grievances, the socialist junta continued until a suitable civilian administration could be put in place. After fighting against a right wing rebellion in the mid-1980s, President Ortega finally made concessions and dissolved the Junta to officially become President. His government moderated after the fall of the Soviet Union, abandoning Marxism-Leninism and restoring relations with the Catholic Church. Despite restoring free elections to the country Ortega has won every election since 1990. The opposition have accused him of running a dictatorship in all but name. Despite this Ortega remains stronger than ever and shows no interest in leaving his position."
