 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_PAULO_MALUF_DESC:0 "Paulo Salim Maluf was born in São Paulo, the son of Lebanese immigrants. His family was by no means poor, they were friends and associates of President Artur da Costa e Silva. It was through this friendship that Maluf managed to be appointed as mayor of his hometown. He became known for his authoritarian governance and his fondness of large-scale infrastructure projects that his administration could not afford. With his built-up influence he managed to be appointed Governor of São Paulo. He tried to use his position as governor as a springboard for a presidential run, donating ambulances to impoverished communities and hosting influential politicians free of charge. After being elected as a federal deputy he tried to win the nomination for ARENA in the ‘85 election but he was snubbed by the civilian caucus for his immoderate and arrogant reputation and José Sarney was chosen instead. Maluf did not stop, however. He ran for mayor once more and secured his election that same year, building up a political legacy which came to be termed “malufismo” by journalists. After the creation of the South American Parliament he ran as the candidate for Southeast Brazil was elected as a deputy. In 2002 he defeated Senator José Agripino Maia for the ARENA nomination, eventually winning the election handily against Romero Jucá. Having achieved his desired post he worked even harder to keep it, gathering allies in the military, spending generously in the public sector and as described by foreign press “turning raw force into mob rule”. Despite being reelected in 2006 he faces a long list of issues including the unstable economy, continued hostility from the United States and the inability of both the opposition and some members of ARENA to cooperate with the President."

 #IDEAS
 SOU_military_power:0 "Military Power"
 SOU_military_power_desc:0 "The South American Union is ruled by the military, more specifically the Brazilian military. Though the army is officially multilingual and open to all ethnicities the Brazilian officers still hold nearly all power in the army and exert enormous influence over the government. The president follows only their whims, the commands of other cliques and that of dark money. The military is the only thing that keeps the unstable union together and thus they have made investment in the arms industry one of the highest priorities for the government."

 SOU_emerging_industry:0 "Emerging Industry"
 SOU_emerging_industry_desc:0 "After the economic troubles of the early 80’s many European and American companies decided to seek new areas to expand to. With the service sector slowly outpacing the industrial sector in the western world the industry started moving south. The Union was the perfect place for this because of the lack of workers’ rights and opportunities for unionizing. Today the country is the second largest economy in the western hemisphere, after the United States, but the lack of a social safety net and protection for workers’ means most of the population is still poor."

 SOU_corrupt_society:0 "Corrupt Society"
 SOU_corrupt_society_desc:0 "Ever since the inception of our union in 1991 our society has been infested with corruption. From the highest officials to the lowest bureaucrats and business owners buying favor and influence is common. There have been a number of scandals over the years and many suspect even the president is involved in highly illegal activities. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of civil rights and civilian oversight in the government. If our union is to stay united this issue will have to be solved, either quietly or by force."

 SOU_linguistic_divide:0 "Linguistic Divide"
 SOU_linguistic_divide_desc:0 "Our country, though united in faith and destiny is divided among linguistic and ethnic lines. Almost three fourths of the union speak Portuguese, which has become the standard language for most official occasions. The remaining sixty million citizens speak Spanish, which greatly varies from north to south. Though internal boundaries within the Union were abolished in 1994 they still remain in practice, with local officials using the language most common in their area. While this has kept a lid on large separatist movements it has also furthered the divide between the government and the regions of Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Integrating Spanish speakers into the military has been particularly troublesome."
