 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_PAULO_MALUF_DESC:0 "Paulo Maluf entered politics thanks to his family’s friendship with President Artur da Costa e Silva. He was appointed mayor of São Paulo and served for two years before being appointed governor of the state of São Paulo by ARENA, the party in support of the country’s military government. He tried to use his newfound political influence to run for president in 1985, but he was rejected by the ARENA civilian caucus. In 1991 Brazil signed the Treaty of Ascunción alongside Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia and Bolivia. This treaty established a common market, an integrated security service and external borders between the five countries. Though Bolivia withdrew following the 1992 revolution, the four remaining members signed Treaty of Montevideo in 1994 which furthered integration and officially created the South American Union. The same year Maluf was elected to the newly established Congress of South America as a member of the Union Alliance, the successors to ARENA. He served as a congressman for eight years before being nominated by the Union Alliance for the 2006 presidential election, which he won handily against the Democratic Movement’s Romero Jucá. Maluf worked hard to gain his position and even harder to keep it. He gathered allies among the military and used generous welfare programs to sway the population. Despite this the opposition is organizing across the country and Maluf’s position remains fragile."

 #IDEAS
 SOU_military_power:0 "Military Power"
 SOU_military_power_desc:0 "The South American Union is ruled by the military, more specifically the Brazilian military. Though the army is officially multilingual and open to all ethnicities the Brazilian officers still hold nearly all power in the army and exert enormous influence over the government. The president follows only their whims, the commands of other cliques and that of dark money. The military is the only thing that keeps the unstable union together and thus they have made investment in the arms industry one of the highest priorities for the government."

 SOU_emerging_industry:0 "Emerging Industry"
 SOU_emerging_industry_desc:0 "After the economic troubles of the early 80’s many European and American companies decided to seek new areas to expand to. With the service sector slowly outpacing the industrial sector in the western world the industry started moving south. The Union was the perfect place for this because of the lack of workers’ rights and opportunities for unionizing. Today the country is the second largest economy in the western hemisphere, after the United States, but the lack of a social safety net and protection for workers’ means most of the population is still poor."

 SOU_corrupt_society:0 "Corrupt Society"
 SOU_corrupt_society_desc:0 "Ever since the inception of our union in 1991 our society has been infested with corruption. From the highest officials to the lowest bureaucrats and business owners buying favor and influence is common. There have been a number of scandals over the years and many suspect even the president is involved in highly illegal activities. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of civil rights and civilian oversight in the government. If our union is to stay united this issue will have to be solved, either quietly or by force."

 SOU_linguistic_divide:0 "Linguistic Divide"
 SOU_linguistic_divide_desc:0 "Our country, though united in faith and destiny is divided among linguistic and ethnic lines. Almost three fourths of the union speak Portuguese, which has become the standard language for most official occasions. The remaining sixty million citizens speak Spanish, which greatly varies from north to south. Though internal boundaries within the Union were abolished in 1994 they still remain in practice, with local officials using the language most common in their area. While this has kept a lid on large separatist movements it has also furthered the divide between the government and the regions of Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Integrating Spanish speakers into the military has been particularly troublesome."

 #Elections postponed
 south_america.1.t:0 "Elections Postponed"
 south_america.1.d:0 "Elections in the South American Union have never been a smooth process. Ever since the riots of 1994 the military has been carefully monitoring every every election, fearing that a candidate or their followers could challenge the established order. The run-up to this year’s election has been the most tumultuous in a decade. Protests, political rallies and violence has wreaked havoc in the minds of the voters. Meanwhile the country continues it’s economic downturn. In order to deal with these issues President Maluf held a meeting with his cabinet, leading bureaucrats and the military command the previous year. The talks were reported as successful and the president emerged to assure the people of the union that they were safe. Now, just weeks away from the presidential election Maluf held another speech, declaring that elections would be postponed until October. The declaration was met with mixed reactions. While the move was supported by the military and most of the government, the announcement did not go over well with the opposition. Some called for boycotts while others saw it as an opportunity to run an even more intense campaign. Following the announcement a number of protests broke out in cities across the country and the military command is scrambling to formulate a plan on how to suppress the protestors."

 #Protests for democracy
 south_america.2.t:0 "Protests for Democracy"
 south_america.2.d:0 "The 15th of January was supposed to be election day. Now with the postponement of elections the people came out in the streets in support for democracy and transparency. Initially security forces were overwhelmed by the hordes of protestors that emerged and President Maluf personally approved the deployment of military police forces to numerous cities. International media is reporting that the police used rubber bullets against protestors and that more than ten people have already died as a result of police brutality. Despite heavy dissuasion the riots show no sign of stopping. On the initiative of Director Rogério Galloro the Union Intelligence Service has been investigating whether the protestors could have been influenced by socialist or communist militants, though no clear link has been found yet."

 #Protests suppressed
 south_america.3.t:0 "Protests Suppressed"
 south_america.3.d:0 "After three long weeks it seems that the protests are slowly dying down. General Enzo Martins Peri, who is responsible for most of the armed forces in Brazil, was called to Paraguay by General Lino Oviedo to help control the riots that had broken out in Asunción. Now General Peri has returned and he assured the president that the situation is under control. The harsh response from the security forces seem to have dissuaded many would-be protestors. But the underlying issues that caused the protests are still present. President Maluf spoke to reporters outside the Planalto Palace, assuring them that the country was returning to normalcy. He also called on the opposition to help ensure that this year’s presidential election could be carried out without violence or unrest. The speech ended with the president announcing that he would return to campaigning for the welfare and security of all people in the union. "

 #President meets opposition
 south_america.4.t:0 "President Meets Opposition Leader"
 south_america.4.d:0 "Today President Maluf invited opposition leader Romero Jucá to his office. The meeting had not been announced to any media beforehand and the subject remains quite mysterious. Experts have speculated that the meeting was an effort to calm the tensions in the country, showing some form of unity between the government and the opposition. Some have gone further, explaining that the meeting was likely called so that Maluf could negotiate or threaten Jucá to keep his supporters in check. The two presidential candidates were greeted on the steps of the Planalto Palace by reporters from both state and international media, where Maluf announced that both the Union Alliance and the Democratic Movement would be working towards increasing transparency in the democratic process. Upon his return to the parliament Jucá was interviewed again, where stated that the talks had been fruitful but that he was unsure whether Maluf was determined enough to fulfill his end of the bargain. Jucá also reiterated that the Democratic Movement is the party that truly represents the drive towards democracy in the union. The president chose not to comment on this interview."

 #Opposition leader assassinated
 south_america.5.t:0 "Opposition Leader Stabbed"
 south_america.5.d:0 "Terrifying news from Rio de Janeiro. The leader of the Democratic Movement, Romero Jucá has been stabbed in the streets. The candidate had just held a speech in a small suburb and was greeting a crowd of supporters when a young assailant ran up to him and stabbed him in the stomach. Security forces were not able to act in time and the supporters of Jucá attacked the assassin, beating him to the verge of death. In the chaos that ensued the wounded presidential hopeful was trampled by his supporters. Ambulances were able to arrive quickly and brought both men to the nearest hospital. Jucá struggled for his life for hours but unfortunately, despite the efforts of the doctors and nurses at the Samaritano hospital, passed away at 4:24 this morning. Rumors have already spread about the assassin, who is still in a medically induced coma at the same hospital. A few have blamed communist guerillas from the outer regions of the union, some have blamed the CIA. But the majority blame the government. Protestors have already begun pouring into the streets again. Numerous cabinet members have advised that the president declare a national emergency and cancel elections all together."
