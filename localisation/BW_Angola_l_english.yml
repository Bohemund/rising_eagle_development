 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_JONAS_SAVIMBI_DESC:0 "Jonas Savimbi began his career in the communist youth wing of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola, then the largest liberation movement fighting against Portuguese rule. His tenure in the MPLA did not last last long however, he left the party after being refused a scholarship in Moscow by the MPLA leadership. Instead he joined the newly-formed National Liberation Front of Angola, led by Holden Roberto. The FNLA fought against both Portuguese and MPLA forces for a decade until the Carnation Revolution in Portugal led to the decolonization of Angola. Control over Angola was handed to a coalition between the MPLA and the FNLA, which quickly broke down and descended into civil war. Savimbi’s skill in guerilla warfare soon made him the commander of FNLA forces and, in 1976, vice-president of the FNLA. He rebuilt the FNLA military following a series of defeats and in 1978 became the leader of the group when Roberto was ousted. The FNLA went on the offensive and captured more territory while the international support for the MPLA decreased. In 1987 the capital city of Luanda was encircled by the FNLA and President José Eduardo dos Santos was forced to negotiate with Savimbi. The ensuing agreement led to the first democratic elections in the country’s history, which Savimbi won. He assumed the presidency while the MPLA soon returned to fighting his government. His time as president of Angola has been marked by numerous insurgent groups aiming to topple his regime while politicians in his coalition are positioning themselves to be the successor of the aging guerilla warrior."
