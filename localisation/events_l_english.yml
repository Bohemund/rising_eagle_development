This fight later led to the creation of the Czechoslovak Liberation Front, an union of various politicians from various political parties which were banned from any activities by the communist government. Their goals were simple. Increased liberties of the citizens of the CSSR, end of political persecution and of the denial of acces to higher education for people from various backgrounds. Under the leadership of Petr Kučera the party has organized various rallies in cities accros the country but was quickly suppresed by the police and its leaders, including Kučera himself were arrested and handed over to the KGB.
