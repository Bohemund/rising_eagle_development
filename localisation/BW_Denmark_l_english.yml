 POLITICS_MOGENS_LYKKETOFT_DESC:0 "Mogens Lykketoft has been involved in Danish politics almost all of his life. Already at age twenty he got engaged in union organizing. He rose rapidly through the ranks of LO, the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions and eventually also the ranks of Social Democracy, the left-wing political hegemon. Lykketoft's first moment in the spotlight came in 1975, when the Social Democratic government with the support of LO passed the policy called “ØD” or Economic Democracy, which he had been an important figure in rallying public support for. This was not to last, however. In 1985 he watched in horror as the centre-right government in an unpopular move abolished ØD, undoing ten years of progressive labour legislation. This motivated Lykketoft to take the fight to Parliament directly, and in the next election in 1987 he ran for the Social Democrats. While the government held on by the slimmest of margins, Lykketoft entered parliament for the first time, beginning a long and illustrious career and even becoming the Minister of Labour during Poul Nyrup’s government in 1994, in a landslide victory brought on by the recession. During this period, Lykketoft worked hard trying to bring back ØD, but to no avail, which eventually made him challenge the incumbent leadership after the upset defeat in the 2005 General Election. Lykketoft won, and led the Social Democrats back into government in 2007. His government has since strengthened the welfare state and invested in the state sector, but it has also been marked with stark opposition from the rapidly rising Progress Party, and many wonder if the Social Democrats will be able to retain a majority come the next elections."
