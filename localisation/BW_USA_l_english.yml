USA.1.t:0 "Bernie Sanders Elected President"
USA.1.d:0 "Senator from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders has been elected as the 46th President of the United States of America in a stunning culmination of an explosive and populist campaign that took relentless aim at the institutions and long-held ideals of American democracy. After the tragic and untimely death of President Baldwin fresh elections were called by acting President Jeff Sessions, Senator Sanders announced his candidacy for President and the formation of his new party, the “American Labor Party”, in a move that shocked the American political establishment. The suprise outcome of the election has shocked both the Democrats and the Republicans. Senator Sanders’ campaign managed to become a viable alternative to the two-party system, managing a rapidly growing grassroots movement. His victory is mostly attributed to the youth, liberal and mostly ignored blue-collar worker vote who felt that the American Dream had been betrayed amid decades of globalization and income inequality. His victory in 2010 could spell the death of the two-party system and the American political establishment, replaced by a more democratic system.

 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_CHUCK_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Chuck Baldwin’s journey from pastor to President is one of the most famous stories in modern America. He founded the Crossroads Baptist Church in Florida and was inspired by Ronald Reagan to enter politics, which he did when he won a congressional seat in 1994. His close friendship with President Pat Robertson helped elevate him to the national stage where he became known as a conservative advocate for small government and non-interventionism. Robertson was succeeded by President John McCain, who Baldwin came to oppose due to McCain’s initiatives to deregulate international trade and the NATO expansion eastwards following the fall of the Soviet Union. At the end of McCain’s term Baldwin emerged as a dark-horse candidate in the Republican primaries. He won the Iowa Caucus in an upset and continued strong straight to the convention, where he secured his nomination. Together with his friend and running mate Darrell Castle he defeated the Democratic nominee Joe Lieberman in a landslide. His win was followed by Republican victories in both the House and Senate, which had been dominated by the Democrats for nearly twenty years. Despite this majority Baldwin has not been able to push through many reforms, as his policies deeply contrast the Republican establishment."

 #SPIRITS
 USA_NASA:0 "National Aeronautics and Space Administration"
 USA_NASA_desc:0 "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the agency responsible for the American civilian space program. Established in 1958, NASA has led most American space exploration efforts. It’s greatest success was the Apollo Program, which landed an American on the Moon in 1970. The agency also led a number of other missions including the Space Shuttle, Space Station Freedom and Artemis programs. Since its creation NASA has been a pioneer of research in engineering, physics and robotics. The agency has greatly advanced human understanding of both the world and what lies beyond it."
 USA_republican_dominance:0 "Republican Dominance"
 USA_republican_dominance_desc:0 "From the Seventies onward the Democratic Party controlled both the House and the Senate of the United States. Their dominance over federal politics prevented many Republican presidents from getting their policies through. This ended in 2008, with the landslide victory for Chuck Baldwin and the Republican Party. With the Republicans controlling both the executive and legislative branches, the door has been opened to sweeping reforms by the government."

 #EVENTS
 usa.1.t:0 "2010 State of the Union Address"
 usa.1.d:0 "Today the United States Congress opened with a joint session of both houses, as President Chuck Baldwin held his first State of the Union Address. Flanked on either side by Vice President Darrell Castle and Speaker of the House Jeff Sessions, President Baldwin commended the Congress for what had been accomplished during his first year of office and laid out a plan for the new year. He began his speech with a budget message, vowing to cut taxes and expenditures in the coming year. He continued by praising the administration’s accomplishments in curbing the Mexican drug trade by deploying the National Guard to the border. Then he acclaimed the economic state of the union, as the administration’s policies had increased economic growth across the country. The House Minority Leader and opposition remained unusually quiet, rarely applauding at all while the Republican majorities in both houses gave the president several standing ovations. This continued until the end, when Baldwin sharpened his tone. Instead of praising, he chastised the Congress for failing to uphold the will of the people and then announced the introduction of a senate bill that would terminate the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in 1949. Instead of awaiting applause, the president quickly disappeared alongside his entourage, leaving both Congress and viewers at home stunned."
