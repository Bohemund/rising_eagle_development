USA.1.t:0 "Bernie Sanders Elected President"
USA.1.d:0 "Senator from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders has been elected as the 46th President of the United States of America in a stunning culmination of an explosive and populist campaign that took relentless aim at the institutions and long-held ideals of American democracy. After the tragic and untimely death of President Baldwin fresh elections were called by acting President Jeff Sessions, Senator Sanders announced his candidacy for President and the formation of his new party, the “American Labor Party”, in a move that shocked the American political establishment. The suprise outcome of the election has shocked both the Democrats and the Republicans. Senator Sanders’ campaign managed to become a viable alternative to the two-party system, managing a rapidly growing grassroots movement. His victory is mostly attributed to the youth, liberal and mostly ignored blue-collar worker vote who felt that the American Dream had been betrayed amid decades of globalization and income inequality. His victory in 2010 could spell the death of the two-party system and the American political establishment, replaced by a more democratic system.
USA.1.a:0 "Hail to the Chief!"

 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_CHUCK_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Chuck Baldwin's journey from pastor to President is one of the most famous stories in modern America. Born in the Midwest, Baldwin soon moved to the South where he received a master’s degree in theology. Together with his wife and four friends he founded the Crossroads Baptist Church in Florida, where he became pastor. Though he and his father had both been lifelong Democrats he changed his political affiliation to Republican in 1988, in support of Ronald Reagan. Despite Baldwin’s efforts to campaign and register voters Reagan was not able to carry the state and lost to John Glenn. Baldwin continued his political career as a Republican, becoming a strong supporter of President Pat Robertson. He ran unsuccessfully for the House in 1992, but succeeded and became a representative in 1994. Throughout the nineties and early noughts he kept a low profile in Congress while engaging with the public through his radio program, which became one of the most listened to in the country. Baldwin was a strong advocate for small government, conservatism, American patriotism and non-interventionism. He railed against the Gulf War, the interests of Wall Street and government corruption. With his appeal and popularity he emerged as a dark-horse candidate in the 2008 Republican primaries, fighting to become the successor of President John McCain. He unexpectedly won the Iowa Caucus and continued strong straight to the convention, where he secured his nomination. Together with his friend and running mate Darrell Castle they defeated Joe Lieberman, the Democratic nominee, in a landslide. His win was followed by Republican victories in both the House and Senate, which had been dominated by the Democrats for nearly twenty years. Despite this majority Baldwin has not been able to push through many reforms. His proposals to withdraw from NATO and the United Nations have met fierce backlash from the party establishment and further conflict is brewing if his presidency cannot fulfill his promises."
