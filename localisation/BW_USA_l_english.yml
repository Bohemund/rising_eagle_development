 decision_event.1.t:0 "1952 Presidential Election"
 decision_event.1.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1952 was the 42nd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won a close victory over sitting Democratic President Harry S. Truman, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932. The incumbent President entered the primaries with moderate support but was initially challenged by populist Senator Estes Kefauver. Truman managed to race ahead once the Allied Offensive began in September, breaking the long stalemate south of the 38th parallel that had characterized much of the Korean War. The President rallied the party to his side and was nominated on the second presidential ballot of the 1952 Democratic National Convention, defeating Kefauver, Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, and other candidates. Believing the current Vice President Alben W. Barkley to be too old, Truman and a small group of Democratic leaders chose John Sparkman, a Southern Democrat, prominent conservative and segregationist as his running mate. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Governor Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young anti-Communist Senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate. Eisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, "I Like Ike." Eisenhower and Truman remained close throughout the race but in the end Ike’s popularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 51% of the popular vote to Truman’s 48%. The electoral vote however came very close, within a 10 elector margin. Eisenhower carried most of the Midwest, northeast and west which managed to make up for the Democrats’ strong base in the South. Republicans also won control of both houses of Congress."

 decision_event.2.d:0 "The Korean Peace Agreement, known commonly around the world as the 'surrender at Hyesan' was the unconditional surrender of all forces belonging to the proclaimed Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on May 28th, 1953. In the weeks preceding, a small remaining number of troops were isolated within the northeastern tip of Korea, notably after the fall of Kanggye to Allied forces. At Hyesan the last remaining North Korean commanders and politicians waited and held the ground so that troops could be evacuated across the Yalu River into the People’s Republic of China. On the twenty-eighth of May General Mark Clark's troops surrounded the city, and the following day acting President Kim Tu-bong signed an agreement that formally terminated all remaining DPRK forces on the Korean peninsula and put the entire region under the control of the Republic of Korea, even though they were already recognized as the legitimate Korean government by most of the UN. The surrender at Hyesan was not just a victory in conflict for America, but also a major propaganda success, with the image of victorious Allied soldiers being spread far and wide across the world. America had won its first victory against their new enemy, Communism."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "The 1953 Iranian coup d'etat was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States. Mossadegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation and to limit the company's control over Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to rule more firmly as monarch."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat was a covert operation carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Arbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Arbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America."

 decision_event.9.d:0 "The Suez Crisis was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aims were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalized the canal. In the summer of 1954 a number of attacks on British and American civilians had turned opinion against Egyptian nationalism and strengthened the ties between the Israel and the United States. On 29 October, Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai. Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. On 5 November, Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they did block the canal to all shipping. After the fighting had started the Soviet Union and the United Nations attempted to pressure the three nations from withdrawing, but America defended their actions as peacekeeping. President Eisenhower had to step in and hold a speech at the UN which would eventually lead to a ceasefire. The Suez Canal was closed from October 1956 until May 1957. Israel fulfilled most its objectives, such as attaining freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran and creating instability in Egypt which would eventually lead to the removal of Nasser. As a result of the conflict, Israel was able to maintain military control over the Sinai and ownership of the canal was transferred back to the Suez Canal Company."

 decision_event.5.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1956 was the 43rd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 6, 1956. The incumbent President, Republican Dwight Eisenhower successfully ran for re-election. Eisenhower, who had first become famous for his military leadership in World War II, had become far more popular than expected due to his successful, tough stance on Communism. He was unopposed at the Republican National Convention and faced a broad national following even greater than his first election campaign. Senator Stuart Symington defeated Adlai Stevenson, Governor William Harriman and other candidates to seize the Democratic Party's nomination, with the backing of Harry Truman and the Democratic establishment. Symington appealed to the legacy of Truman and Roosevelt, calling for a significant increase in government spending on social programs and warning that more years under a Republican administration could lead to a second Great Depression. In the end, Symington's attempt at recreating the “New Deal” populist movement of the 1930’s was ineffective against the sheer popularity and likeableness of Eisenhower, handing a second term to the President on election night. The incumbent maintained support with Republicans and made significant gains among Democrats, especially white urban Southerners and Northern Catholics."

 decision_event.6.t:0 "Civil Rights Movement"
 decision_event.6.d:0 "The Civil Rights Movement was a decades-long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already held. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans. Moderates in the movement worked with Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation overturning discriminatory practices. President Kennedy's Civil Rights Act of 1963 expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. Successive legislation rapidly ended legal inequality in the United States, most notably during the Kennedy Presidency and his successor Nelson Rockefeller's first years. From 1962 through 1971, a wave of inner-city riots in black communities undercut support from the white middle class, but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from about 1963 to 1982, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence, and instead demanding that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency be built in the black community. Charismatic universally recognised leader of the civil rights movement Martin Luther King played a significant role in inspiring millions around the nation, and his assassination attempt is seen as the final blow against pro-segregation movements."

 decision_event.7.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1960 was the 44th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960. In a closely contested election, Democrat John F. Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican Vice President Richard Nixon. This was the first election in which all fifty states participated and the first in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for another term. Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Kennedy, a Massachusetts senator on the other hand battled against a range of adversaries. Most notably the experienced Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who Kennedy would ask to serve has his running mate. The issue of the Cold War dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kennedy safely seized the highest number of electoral college votes, beating Nixon by nearly 150 electorates. The popular vote however was one of the closest in recent history, the difference between both candidates being less than 1%. The issue was complicated by unpledged electors from Mississippi and Alabama casting their votes for Senator Harry F. Byrd, a southern conservative. Kennedy championed his slogan of the “New Frontier”, which would include the elimination of poverty and racial injustice, the expansion of infrastructure  and education as well as science and space research. The young senator was charismatic, a strong debater and managed his campaign well, focusing on swing states whereas Nixon campaigned all over the country. Kennedy also had the support of the big-city bosses who increased turnout in urban areas and Johnson who held the South. The Democrats also held the Senate while gaining the majority of seats in Congress."

 decision_event.8.d:0 "The Cuban Missile Crisis was a 19-day confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union concerning American ballistic missile deployment in Italy and Turkey with consequent Soviet ballistic missile deployment in Cuba. In response to a failed counterrevolutionary coup in Havana, sponsored by the United States and Haiti, Soviet leader Malenkov decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during telephone calls between Malenkov and Fidel Castro in March 1961 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that Summer. President Kennedy ordered the US Navy to establish a blockade, preventing any further Soviet missiles from reaching the island. Kennedy is said to have stated to Lyndon Johnson after the fact that the blockade was a deliberate provocation, he wanted to test the Soviets following the American triumph in the Korean War. The President announced to a White House press conference that the United States would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba. Demands were subsequently made that the remaining missiles be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union. After a long period of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between President Kennedy and Malenkov. On August 12, 1961, the Soviets agreed to dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again. In turn the United States agreed that it would dismantle their missiles in Turkey, but the missiles in Italy were never mentioned. The crisis remains a low point for Soviet supremacy in the Cold War, giving Washington an edge that would last for at least another decade and prompting a political crisis in Moscow."

 decision_event.10.d:0 "The Gulf of Tonkin incident was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in Indochina. It involved two separate confrontations between North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. On August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. Maddox fired three warning shots and the North Vietnamese boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire. One U.S. aircraft was damaged, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats were damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were killed, with six more wounded. The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted President John F. Kennedy the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by "communist aggression". The resolution served as Kennedy's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam, and is thus seen as the start of the Vietnam War."

 decision_event.11.d:0 "The 1964 United States presidential election was the 45th quadrennial American presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1964. Incumbent Democratic President John F. Kennedy defeated William Scranton, the Republican nominee. Kennedy easily defeated segregationist Governor George Wallace of Alabama in the primary before being nominated on the first ballot of the Democratic Convention. In one of the most contested Republican primaries in recent memory Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, a moderate Republican, defeated conservative Senator Barry Goldwater after Nelson Rockefeller had dropped out of the race. Scranton entered the race late and had to fight tooth and nail at the Democratic Convention to win over delegates, arguing that Goldwater’s conservatism made him unelectable by a majority of the electorate. Kennedy championed his passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1963, and his campaign continued to advocate for his anti-poverty programs collectively known as the “New Frontier.” Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was one of the most fervent supporters of this program, having been one of its principal architects. Scranton campaigned on his principal issue of education reform and integration, a program he had already implemented in Pennsylvania. Scranton argued that education was the right method to defeat Communism and he advocated extending his policies to the rest of the states. With Kennedy’s massive popularity the Democrats managed to hold their ground and even gain many states, including Maine which had not voted Democratic since 1916. This was the first presidential election after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1963, which had led to mass enfranchisement of racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. The election defeated many conservative Republican congressmen, giving Kennedy a majority that could overcome the conservative coalition which had hindered many reforms during his first term."

 decision_event.12.d:0 "The term “New Frontier” was first used by Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy in his acceptance speech in the 1960 United States presidential election to the Democratic National Convention as the slogan to inspire America to support him. The phrase developed into a label for his administration's domestic and foreign programs. The main goal was the total elimination of poverty and racial injustice, the expansion of education and the establishment of a space program to rival that of the Soviet Union. The Kennedy administration launched new major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation. The program and its initiatives were subsequently promoted by him and fellow Democrats in Congress in the 1960s and years following. The New Frontier in scope and sweep resembled the New Deal domestic agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Kennedy was greatly aided by Vice President Johnson, who had created large parts of the program. After the Democratic sweep of the House and Senate in 1964 the program could be implemented with more certainty but many anti-war Democrats complained that spending on the Vietnam War choked off the New Frontier. The programs continued to expand under the subsequent Rockefeller administration and eventually also under his brother Ted Kennedy."

 decision_event.13.d:0 "The Vietnam War was a conflict that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on December 1974, with U.S. involvement ending that same year. Beginning in 1950, American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina. Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. The Viet Cong, a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North, fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region, while the People's Army of Vietnam engaged in more conventional warfare, and had launched armed struggles from 1959 onward. U.S. involvement escalated in 1960 under President John F. Kennedy, with troop levels gradually surging from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. By 1964 there were 23,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, but this escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Kennedy broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000. Every year onward there was significant build-up despite little progress, with Robert McNamara, one of the principal architects of the war, beginning to express doubts of victory by the end of 1966. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes. The U.S. conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. After the Tet Offensive of 1968, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam unconventional and conventional capabilities increased following a period of neglect and became modeled on heavy fire-power focused doctrines like US forces. Operations crossed international borders; bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were used by North Vietnam as supply routes and were heavily bombed by U.S. forces."

The Republican nominee, Governor Nelson Rockefeller, defeated the Democratic nominee, incumbent Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson was Kennedy’s expected successor and front-runner for his party's nomination, but he was challenged by Eugene McCarthy, who campaigned against the Vietnam War, and Governor George Wallace of Alabama. Johnson won the presidential nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which saw numerous anti-war protests. Rockefeller entered the 1968 Republican primaries as the front-runner, and he defeated Harold Stassen, Ronald Reagan, and other candidates at the 1968 Republican National Convention to win his party's nomination. George Wallace, having been defeated in the Democratic primaries formed his own “Democratic Independent Party” in order to challenge the two liberal nominees. His goal was to prevent any candidate from gaining a majority and to send the election to the House where he could broker a deal with either party to end desegregation. The election year was tumultuous; it was marked by the assassination attempt on Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses. Rockefeller ran on a campaign that promised new leadership and pragmatism, especially in Vietnam. He championed his record as Governor of New York where he had increased spending on infrastructure, education and created environmental protections. He maintained support among organized labor, African Americans, Hispanics and city dwellers, demographics that were typically in the Democratic camp. Johnson promised to continue Kennedy's programs, support the Civil Rights Movement and end the Vietnam War through a swift American victory. Rockefeller won a plurality of the popular vote by a narrow margin, but won by a large margin in the Electoral College, carrying most states outside of the South, with the Deep South going to Wallace, leaving the Democrats with little to show for."
