 #LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
 POLITICS_MESUT_YILMAZ_DESC:0 "Mesut Yılmaz’s meteoric rise to power began when he was elected to the Grand National Assembly in the pivotal election of 1981. Having previously studied political science and economics in Germany, Yılmaz was brought in as Minister for Trade in the cabinet of Bülent Ecevit. When the government was swept up in the Köykent Scandal of 1988, Ecevit resigned and the Republican People’s Party held an emergency party convention. Yılmaz had become the leader of group of young, western-oriented intellectuals within the party. His faction, though at odds with the leftist leadership, emerged ahead at the convention and Yılmaz was elected Prime Minister of Turkey for the first time. After winning a snap general election that same year he began to implement his vision for modernization, moving the CHP to the political center and moving Turkey towards closer European cooperation. The culmination of decades of overtures and negotiations between Turkey and Europe was in 1991, when Turkey was accepted into the European Economic Community. Turkey’s integration into the European market helped to cushion the blow of the 1991 Economic Crisis, but Turkey still felt the effects of the recession. Popular opinion turned against the CHP and the party lost the 1992 election to Tansu Çiller and the Justice Party. Yılmaz left politics and remained retired for seven years until the fateful year of 1999, when Turkey was shaken by both earthquakes and a banking crisis. He gave in to popular demand and returned as leader of the CHP before being elected Prime Minister again in 2000, running on a platform of economic renewal and welfare expansion. Since then he has been the most powerful man in Turkey, but he faces opposition not just from the Justice Party, but also the rising forces of nationalism, Islamism and radical cliques within the military."

 #IDEAS
 TUR_interventionist_military:0 "Interventionist Military"
 TUR_interventionist_military_desc:0 "The Turkish military believes they are the protector of Kemalist principles and the nation's economic and political stability. This is why they believe it’s their duty to intervene and save their homeland from threats from both inside and outside. This situation has caused a lot of unpredictability in the political and fiscal spheres because no one know what move they will do next. This distrust between the military and the politicians may lead to conflict in the near future."

 TUR_patriotic_society:0 "Patriotic Society"
 TUR_patriotic_society_desc:0 "Even though the country has been divided politically, the nation is still united under the Turkish flag. The patriotic people of Turkey dont tend to pay attention if the government’s in chaos and danger but if there’s a threat to the state, the backbone of Turkish society, people rally around the country's best interests. "

 #EVENTS
 turkey.1.t:0 "Erbakan Resigns"
 turkey.1.d:0 "Today Necmettin Erbakan, the leader of the National Order Party since 1970 and the “Father of Turkish political Islam” has announced that he’s resigning due to his poor health and old age. This unfortunate announcement has created a leadership contest in the party, with two factions vying for power. The first to announce his candidacy to succeed Erbakan was Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the former Mayor of Istanbul. He is an outspoken conservative and by far the most popular politician in the party. Opposing him is the political moderate, Aykut Edibali. His supporters insist that Erdoğan is too radical to be elected leader and that the party should instead shift its focus from political Islam to conservative nationalism. Each candidate has accused each other of disrespecting Erbakan’s legacy, meanwhile the former leader has refused to make any endorsements. Erdoğan, described as a very charismatic personality by the political establishment, took his cause to the public, holding rallies for his supporters in Istanbul. Meanwhile Edibali held meetings with business leaders to raise funding and met with party delegates. After a short campaign the party voted, and the winner is..?"
