 #LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
 POLITICS_MESUT_YILMAZ_DESC:0 "Mesut Yılmaz’s meteoric rise to power when he was elected to represent the Black Sea province of Rize in the parliament and serving in Özal’s cabinet. He became the Minister for Information, then Minister of Culture and Tourism and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Upon Özal’s election to the presidency in 1989, Yılmaz became the leader of an intra-party opposition to the new Prime Minister, Yıldırım Akbulut. In the summer of 1991 he managed to discharge Yıldırım Akbulut. Because ANAP had the majority in the parliament, he subsequently became Prime Minister of Turkey. Yılmaz also made the Motherland Party more business-friendly and Europe-oriented, causing the more conservative, religious wing to switch to the Welfare Party of Necmettin Erbakan. By far his biggest success was his government negotiating Turkey into the European Commission in 2001, this major success gave him an incredible advantage in the polls but it still couldn’t overshadow the broken economy and ANAP fell to second place behind the DYP led by Tansu Çiller which formed a coalition with the Welfare Party and after 4 years out of power ANAP won 1st place again in 2007 and negotiated a coalition with DYP and the Young Party, now once again Mesut Yılmaz is the most powerful man in Turkey."

 #IDEAS
 TUR_unstable_coalition:0 "Unstable Coalition"
 TUR_unstable_coalition_desc:0 "The ANAP-DYP-GP coalition has been ruling the country since the last general election, but the coalition is uneasy. Tensions between party lines have led the coalition to near collapse but with compromise and negatition the party leaders have managed to keep the coalition afloat, nevertheless this doesn‘t mean that major disagreements and conflict don’t exist within the coalition if radical action is not taken quick enough the coalition will surely collapse. "

 TUR_unpredictable_economy:0 "Unpredictable Economy"
 TUR_unpredictable_economy_desc:0 "The chaos in the political sphere has negatively affected our fiscal sphere. The Turkish economy is continuously collapsing and getting back up in little time. This has resulted in an economic bubble which will lead to inflation, unemployment and austerity if it pops. It has also led to countless protests, demonstrations, strikes and strengthening of unions, if nothing is done to fix the economy the country’s economical sector will collapse."

 TUR_interventionist_military:0 "Interventionist Military"
 TUR_interventionist_military_desc:0 "The Turkish military believes they are the protector of Kemalist principles and the nation's economic and political stability. This is why they believe it’s their duty to intervene and save their homeland from threats from both inside and outside. This situation has caused a lot of unpredictability in the political and fiscal spheres because no one know what move they will do next. This distrust between the military and the politicians may lead to conflict in the near future."

 TUR_patriotic_society:0 "Patriotic Society"
 TUR_patriotic_society_desc:0 "Even though the country has been divided politically, the nation is still united under the Turkish flag. The patriotic people of Turkey dont tend to pay attention if the government’s in chaos and danger but if there’s a threat to the state, the backbone of Turkish society, people rally around the country's best interests. "

 #EVENTS
 turkey.1.t:0 "Nationalist Faction Challenges Çiller"
 turkey.1.d:0 "The new nationalist faction of the True Path Party was founded when many Nationalist Movement members felt threatened by Bahçeli's rising ultranationalism and anti-American sentiment thus left. The leader of this faction, Meral Akşener, has announced that she'll be running for Chairwoman of the party citing Çiller's inability to represent her voters and her party well enough in the coalition. However her announcment has been met with mixed signals from the party, Çiller denounced Akşener calling her a "power hungry demagogue" and the challange "an act of cowardice", on the other hand other Nationalist faction members such as Yusuf Halaçoğlu applauded her for this "act of bravery" and announced their full support. Other party leaders and Prime Minister Yılmaz have refrained from making any comments on the situation. It seems that there may be an Extraordinary Congress any day now."
 turkey.1.o1:0 "Damn it Meral!"

 turkey.2.t:0 "True Path Extraordinary Congress"
 turkey.2.d:0 "Tansu Çiller, chairwoman of the True Path Party, ruled out any possibility of resigning her position in the party, despite facing a leadership challenge from Meral Akşener. This however could not quell further unrest within the party, with several party members declaring their support for opposing candidates. Under the leadership of opposing candidates, delegates critical of Çiller began collecting signatures to force an Extraordinary Congress. On 1 March, Akşener announced that she had successfully collected over 400 signatures, enough to call a congress. The party leadership accepted the outcome and decided to host the Congress. \n\nOf the five contenders announcing their candidacy for the leadership, only two, namely Tansu Çiller and Meral Akşener, appeared to have obtained the required 127 signatures from delegates to formally nominate themselves. The run up to the convention saw fierce infighting between the nationalist and centrist factions of the party. With Akşener scoring a majority of 650 delegates, she is now the Chairwoman of the True Path Party."
 turkey.2.o1:0 "Congratulations, Asena"

 turkey.3.t:0 "Erbakan Resigns"
 turkey.3.d:0 "Today Necmettin Erbakan, the leader of the Welfare Party since 1983 and the “father of Turkish political Islam” has announced that he’s resigning due to his poor health. \n\nThis unfortunate announcement has created a leadership contest in the party. The main candidates are Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the ex-Mayor of Istanbul and an outspoken reformist, Recai Kutan, a trusted friend of Erbakan with ties to conservative traditionalist groups and Aykut Edibali, a rising star in the party and a noted political moderate. Each candidate has accused each other of disrespecting Erbakan’s legacy, meanwhile the former leader has refused to make any endorsements.\n\nErdoğan, described as a very charismatic personality by the political establishment, took his cause to the public, holding rallies for his supporters in Istanbul. Meanwhile Kutan, who has been labeled an insider, visited many distinguished delegates. Edibali on the other hand held meetings with business leaders to raise his funding. \n\nThe delegates voted, and the winner is…"
 turkey.3.o1:0 "Recep Tayyip Erdoğan"
 turkey.3.o2:0 "Recai Kutan"
 turkey.3.o3:0 "Aykut Edibali"

 turkey.4.t:0 "The Resignation of Deniz Baykal"
 turkey.4.d:0 "Today at 13.00, CHP leader started a historic announcement with the words. “I want to inform you, that for the good of the party, I am resigning from my position as the General Secretary of the CHP.” This came as a surprise to the general public, but some political experts have been expecting this for weeks. \n\nThe allegations of child abuse and corruption were too much for the venerable politician to handle, and it seems Baykal decided to let it go peacefully rather than fight. As he thanked his supporters and his colleagues for the last time, and called on everyone to continue Atatürk’s legacy, there were some cries from the audience who had truly believed Baykal would stay. \n\nAt the end of the announcement, Baykal named Muharrem İnce from the party’s Kemalist faction as interim leader and unofficial successor. With that, the party held a very short vote to confirm the resignation, and Deniz Baykal left politics."
 turkey.4.o1:0 "Baykal was a mountain, but change must come."
