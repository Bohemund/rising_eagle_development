 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_NARENDRA_MODI_DESC:0 "Narendra Modi was born in 1950 to a poor family from Gujarat. He was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh at an early age and began attending their local training sessions. After spending two years travelling the country he returned home in 1970 and began to work as a full-time campaigner for the RSS. When Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared the Emergency in 1976, Modi helped organize the RSS against the government. He was forced underground and helped create a network of people wanted by the government. The Saffron Revolution brought an end to the Emergency in 1977 and the subsequent election forced Indira out of office. The new Prime Minister had close ties to the RSS, and Modi was assigned to join the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Initially working as a campaign organizer, he was selected to be Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001. His successes in local elections caught the eye of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who recommended him as the candidate for Prime minister in the next election. When Vajpayee stepped down after 29 years in power, Modi was chosen as leader of the BJS. He led the party successfully in the 2009 General Election and was elected Prime minister of India with an increased mandate not seen since the 90s. A staunch Hindu nationalist and conservative, Modi has expanded the ties between the BJS and RSS, appointing RSS members to prominent positions and enlisting the paramilitary in organizing his campaigns. By capitalizing on 30 years of strong economic growth, India is rapidly expanding its military capabilities in anticipation of another conflict with their rival, the Federation of Pakistan."
