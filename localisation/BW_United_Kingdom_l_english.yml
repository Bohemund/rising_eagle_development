 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_SHIRLEY_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Shirley Williams was part of the original “Gang of Four”, moderates who left the Labour Party in 1981. Alongside future Prime Ministers Roy Jenkins, David Owen and other defecting MPs she became one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party. Later that year she became the first Social Democrat elected to parliament after winning a by-election in Crosby. The SDP formed an alliance with the Liberal Party and two years later they defeated both Labour and the Conservative government of Edward Heath in the general election. Williams became Home Secretary in the first SDP-Liberal Alliance government under Roy Jenkins, then Foreign Secretary under David Owen. While in the cabinet she was one of the architects of the proportional representation system implemented by the Alliance in 1984. She was the natural successor as SDP leader when David Owen stepped down in 1998. Williams led the SDP through a tumultuous decade. Numerous internal affairs threatened the party, but through it all she remained a strong leader of Her Majesty’s opposition. Having relied on cooperation with the increasingly left-wing Labour Party during Owen’s ministry, the SDP rebuilt their relationship with the Liberals, who had come to back Kenneth Clarke’s Conservative government. When the Conservatives were defeated in 2007, Williams formed a government with Liberal support. Though Williams is defined by her political experience and longevity, she now faces the momentous task of ending the decades-long conflict in Ulster, bringing peace to Northern Ireland and uniting the country once and for all."
