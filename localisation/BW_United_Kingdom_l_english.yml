 ENG_the_troubles_desc:0 "The Northern Ireland Conflict, locally known as "The Troubles", is the ongoing guerilla war in Ulster between Irish Republicans and British Unionists. The conflict has troubled Northern Ireland for nearly four decades, beginning in the late sixties. Despite attempts at numerous negotiations and ceasefires the insurgent groups continue to operate, to the dismay of both the government and the public at large."

 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_SHIRLEY_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Shirley Williams was part of the original “Gang of Four” who left the Labour Party in protest of the party’s increasingly left-wing direction. Alongside future Prime Minister David Owen and other defecting MPs she founded the Social Democratic Party in 1981. Later that year she became the first Social Democrat elected to parliament after winning the Crosby by-election. The SDP formed an alliance with the Liberal Party and eventually the two voted to merge into a new party, the Liberal Democrats. Williams supported the merge but Owen opposed it, reforming the Social Democrats and taking most of the moderate Labour vote with him. In 1992 Owen’s SDP defeated the Conservatives and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was running for an unprecedented fourth term. The Social Democrats formed a coalition government with Labour and Owen personally invited Williams to cross the floor and join the government, which she graciously did. She served first as Home Secretary and then Deputy Prime Minister, before succeeding David Owen as leader of the SDP in 2002 after the Conservatives returned to Westminster. Remaining in opposition for 7 years, Williams rebuilt the alliance with the Liberal Democrats and in 2009 launched a campaign for electoral reform and a referendum on entering the European Union. The coalition easily defeated the unpopular Prime Minister Iain Duncan Smith and Shirley Williams was tasked by the Queen to form a government in her name, becoming the second Social Democrat Prime Minister in British history."
