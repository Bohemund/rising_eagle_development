 ITA_mafia_desc:0 "The Mafia is a broad term for organized criminal gangs operating in Italy, the largest of which being the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta and the Neapolitan Camorra. Though many were established even before the 1900s, they achieved prominence after the Second World War. Their criminal activities effect both the economic and social life of many Italians, but also the political process. Many politicians have developed Mafia ties as a way to gain and maintain power, while the Mafiosi uses politicians as protection against the authorities."
