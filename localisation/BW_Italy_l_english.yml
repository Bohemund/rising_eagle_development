 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_SERGIO_MATTARELLA_DESC:0 "It would not be inaccurate to say Sergio Mattarella was destined to lead Italy. His father was a prominent politician and anti-fascist who helped found Christian Democracy in the wake of the Second World War. Sergio’s brother Piersanti was President of Sicily from 1978 until his assassination by the Cosa Nostra in 1980. It was this tragedy that led Mattarella to enter politics. He began by cleaning up the Sicilian branch of Christian Democracy, purging Mafia-connected “men of honor” from the party. By the 1990s he had become Vice-Secretary of Christian Democracy and director of the party’s newspaper Il Popolo. Mattarella was a member of the left-wing faction of the party and a longtime supporter of the Historic Compromise, an accomodation with the Communist Party. This became impossible after the end of the Cold War, when the Italian left realigned around Christian Democracy’s former partner, the Italian Socialist Party. The Christian Democratic left quickly consolidated around the economist Romano Prodi, who led the party to victory in the 1998 election. Mattarella served as Minister of Defence in the Prodi government, overseeing both the abolition of the draft and Italy’s peacekeeping efforts in neighboring Albania. He was the natural choice to lead the party after Prodi stepped down, but he still had to contend with the right-wing of the party, led by Pier Ferdinando Casini and supported by former president Giulio Andreotti. Numerous compromises had to be made, but in the end it was him who led Christian Democracy to victory in 2006, forming a centrist coalition not seen since the end of the Pentapartito. His government faces many challenges, from political corruption and organized crime to an unruly right-wing and the growing neo-fascist movements of the extreme right. "

 ITA_mafia:0 "Mafia Issue"
 ITA_mafia_desc:0 "The Mafia is a broad term for organized criminal gangs operating in Italy, the largest of which are the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta and the Neapolitan Camorra. Though many were established even before the 1900s, they achieved prominence after the Second World War. Their criminal activities effect both the economic and social life of many Italians, but also the political process. Many politicians have developed Mafia ties as a way to gain and maintain power, while the Mafiosi uses politicians as protection against the authorities."
