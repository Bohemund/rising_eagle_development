 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_CHUNG_MONG_JOON_DESC:0 "Chung Mong-joon was born in Busan, in the midst of the Korean War. His father - future president Chung Ju-yung - had abandoned his home and company in Seoul to flee the invading North Korean army. As the United Nations forces pushed back north the Chung family were able to return home. Working with the Korean government Chung Ju-yung was able to grow his company Hyundai from a small construction company to a major conglomerate with stakes in everything from logistics to heavy industry. He became known as a generous philanthropist who was deeply invested in the development of Korea. After the death of Park Chung-hee and the National Harmony Revolution, he became one of the principal members of the refounded Liberal Party, once banned following Park’s declaration of martial law in 1979. He gained the party’s nomination and won the 1992 election. Chung Mong-joon followed his father into politics and was elected to the National Assembly the same year. After ten years as an assembly member and four years as mayor of Seoul he was the expected successor to his father’s legacy. He was elected leader of the Liberal Party and launched a presidential campaign with the support of Korea’s major chaebols, winning the 2008 election by a large margin. Chung Mong-joon now has the great task of continuing Korean prosperity and progress into the next decade while safeguarding the nation’s fragile democracy from those who seek to undermine it."

 KOR_chaebols:0 "Chaebols"
 KOR_chaebols_desc:0 "Chaebols are large industrial conglomerates in Korea that are often controlled by a single family. They consist of a number of affiliate companies controlled by a powerful owner who passes leadership almost hereditarily to another family member upon retirement. The chaebols emerged during the rule of Syngman Rhee and came to dominate the economy during the “Korean Miracle” and Park Chung-hee’s presidency. Chaebols have since the nineties played an active role in politics, with both former Hyundai founder Chung Ju-yung and his son, Chung Mong-joon, serving as presidents. Other major chaebols include the car manufacturer KIA Industries, the textile producer Sunkyong and the retailer Samsung."
 KOR_fragile_democracy:0 "Fragile Democracy"
 KOR_fragile_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy in Korea is both young and fragile. Numerous military coups from the seventies onward has fostered an interventionist culture among military personnel, who see it as their duty to intervene should democracy fail."
