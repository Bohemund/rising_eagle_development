 #EVENTS
 pakistan.1.t:0 "Horrific Interservice Training Accident"
 pakistan.1.d:0 "Tragedy struck the Federation of Pakistan today during an interservice training exercise. The PNS Khaibar, a Tariq-class destroyer operated by the Pakistan Navy, misfired upon an observing battalion of the Punjab Regiment in a test of its naval artillery, killing at least 32 soldiers and General Khalid Shameem Wynne. The international community has been quick to extend their sympathies, with the notable exception of the Republic of India. While the press is still covering the tragedy itself, they will soon begin to ask how the accident, which has been interpreted as a consequence of the political, cultural, and linguistic divide between the army and navy, was allowed to happen and whether it is a symptom of a greater issue within the federation. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is expected to issue a statement on the accident shortly."
 pakistan.1.a:0 "It may be wise to reassess our government."

 pakistan.2.t:0 "How should we proceed?"
 pakistan.2.d:0 "It is time for us to plan a response to the issues in our government's structure. Should we opt for a simple solution to satisfy the populace or aim for genuine, if risky, reform?"
 pakistan.2.a:0 "A simple solution is fine."
 pakistan.2.b:0 "We need real change."

 pakistan.3.t:0 "Opening Renegotiations"
 pakistan.3.d:0 "In order for us to begin to open renegotiations on the federation, we need to bring the other two major parties to the table. This won't be easy, as the Awami League is in a position of stability in the East, with little present concern from upstart third parties while the Pakistan People's Party is diametrically opposed to our party's values. Which party should we invite first?"
 pakistan.3.a:0 "Start with the Pakistan People's Party, our main opposition in the West."
 pakistan.3.b:0 "Start with the Awami League, the unchallenged dominant party in the East."

 pakistan.4.t:0 "The Pakistan People's Party's Conditions"
 pakistan.4.d:0 "While much of the Pakistan People's Party have agreed to our renegotiation, several key figures stand in our way. They are demanding that the government commission an infrastructure project in Sindh to satisfy their constituencies before they agree to attend. While this demand is undoubtedly illegal and would be a misallocation of public funding, accomodating it would be necessary for renegotiations to even begin. How should we respond?"
 pakistan.4.a:0 "Forget this! How about that simple solution?"
 pakistan.4.b:0 "Fine."

 pakistan.5.t:0 "The Awami League's Conditions"
 pakistan.5.d:0 "While much of the Awami League have agreed to our renegotiation, several key figures stand in our way.
