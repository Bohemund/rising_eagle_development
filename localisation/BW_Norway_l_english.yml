 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_KARL_IVAR_HAGEN_DESC:0 "Carl Ivar Hagen began his political career in 1973 when he became a deputy representative in the Storting. Dismayed over the state of conservative in Norway, he joined Anders Lange’s anti-tax protest party. When Lange died the following year, Hagen took his seat in the Storting. Anders Lange’s Party changed their name to the Progress Party, after the Danish party of the same name. Though the party dropped out of parliament they were able to return in 1981, this time with Hagen as their leader. Known as an excellent speaker, Hagen was able to moderate the profile of the party from the more vulgar tone of Anders Lange. He cemented himself as the undisputed leader of the party and in many ways personally controlled its ideology and policies. His populist message against mass immigration and government bureaucracy, while supporting market liberal economics proved popular with the Norwegian people. The party successively increased their support in the Storting. Hagen was elected to the parliament for seven consecutive terms, with his last election he became speaker of the Storting. He served as speaker until the 2009 election, when the Progress Party became the second-largest party in the country. Though a return of the Labour Party seemed inevitable at first, Hagen managed to secure parliamentary support from the Conservative and Centre parties to form his own government. In the year since their election, the Progress Party’s first government has started an overhaul of the Norwegian welfare and immigration systems, as well as expanding ties to the United States, despite their increasing isolationism."
