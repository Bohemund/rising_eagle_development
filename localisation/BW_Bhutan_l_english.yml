 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_JIGME_SINGYE_WANGCHUCK_DESC:0 "Dragon King Jigme Singye Wangchuck received his education in Western institutions, from India to England. Upon his father's death, he became Dragon King in 1972, vowing to the dying head of state in earlier weeks that he would continue his legacy of democratisation and opening up of Bhutan. In the following decades, this is exactly what he did. By establishing various checks and balances and the first stages of a constitutional government, the King ushered in a new era of love between the royal family and its subjects. Since those first years the people of Bhutan have grown to not just revere, but adore their head of state, proud of the many accomplishments he has made, especially in recent years when the national gross domestic product was shown to have increased at an astonishing rate just since the early 2000s. However, at the turn of this decade there are rumours throughout Bhutan that the Dragon King is preparing to abdicate in favour of his eldest son. But an end to their beloved monarch could stoke the flames of great political change."
