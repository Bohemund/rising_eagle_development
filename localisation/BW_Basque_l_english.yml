 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_INIGO_URKULLU_DESC:0 "Iñigo Urkullu has been a member of the Basque Nationalist Party since 1977. He joined the party a year before the assassination of King Juan Carlos I by ETA militants and the subsequent civil war which engulfed Spain. Basque nationalists used this opportunity to rise up against the Madrid government and achieved their independence after the 1980 Toledo Accords. Urkullu developed a close relationship with President Carlos Garaikoetxea and rose to become leader of the Basque Youth Force, the youth wing of the EAJ-PNV in 1980. He entered the Basque Parliament in 1984 and was elected chairman of the party in 1999, when Garaikoetxea retired and the previous chairman, Juan José Ibarretxe, became president. Urkullu led the EAJ-PNV to electoral victory in 2001, 2005 and finally in 2009, when he was sworn in as Lehendakari of the Basque government."
