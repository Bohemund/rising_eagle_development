 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_MOHAMMED_HERSI_MORGAN_DESC:0 "In 1969, Major General Siad Barre led a military coup against the government of Somalia. In it’s aftermath the constitution was suspended and the country was renamed to the Somali Democratic Republic. This new military dictatorship suspended the constitution and promoted wide reforms across the country, from public works to literacy programs. In 1976 the Supreme Revolutionary Council disbanded and established in its place the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party. Based on Marxism-Leninism and Islamic socialism, Barre’s regime established close ties with the Soviet Union. This relationship ended with the Ogaden War, when Somalia invaded the primarily Somali Ogaden region of Ethiopia. The Soviet Union sided with the communist Derg regime of Ethiopia. Somalia received support from the People’s Republic of China and after a large-scale Soviet intervention, the U.S. also courted Barre’s regime. With American and Chinese support Somalia was able to build the largest army in Africa and used it to drive the Ethiopian forces out of Ogaden for good. With his dream of “Greater Somalia” achieved, Siad Barre consolidated his power during the following decades and after his death passed leadership to his son-in-law, General Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan. With the end of the Cold War, Somalia lost its strategic interest and was left without allies or support. Famine remains a constant threat and huge military expenses have drained the treasury, forcing the nation into debt. On top of this underground political movements of liberals and Islamists have grown to pose a threat to Said Hersi Morgan’s dictatorial Marxist regime."
