 RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "What if America won the Cold War?"
 FRA_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "A new era is upon France, the era of glory. France is the strongest power in Europe once again, thanks to a never-ending economic miracle that started after the end of Second World War, They're the leading power of the European Union and a model nation for all countries. France has been lead by incumbent Prime Minister Jean-Louis Borloo and the Radicals for the last 8 years. But with the opposition growing and the election near France has yet to decide it's future."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dismantled and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Another Weltkrieg is on the horizon."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "As a new century dawns the sun rises on a new Japan, free of foreign dictates and oppression. Decades of American meddling in Asian affairs has brought relations to the breaking point. With the election of the Japan Conference in the 2006 general election Japan has stood up against the western hegemony which humiliated them so long ago. Shinzo Abe has wowed safety and independence for the Japanese people. While democracy remains the Prime Minister maintains a strong hold on the country through support from the military. The Empire set their sights on the rest of Asia."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "The world in 2010 is changed. Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union and communism in 1986, NATO and the USA have held a close watch over the world stage. The Republican party has ruled the nation for over 20 years, and under the incumbent President Baldwin they show no signs of stopping. However, with rising nationalism and tensions in South America and Asia, it appears that the American colossus is once again threatened. Will the American order hold?"
 OTHER_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
