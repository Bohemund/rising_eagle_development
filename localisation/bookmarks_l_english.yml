 RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "What if America won the Cold War?"
 USA_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "More than two decades have passed since the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, leaving the United States of America the sole superpower of the world. At first the world rejoiced as President John Glenn declared the beginning of a “New World Order”, but in the decades since the seeds of unrest and radicalism have been sown across the world. Former allies are turning against the United States, now seen as a stagnating power. How long can the American world order last?"
 FRA_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "The 20th century was an uncertain time for France. The nation suffered through two World Wars, occupation, economic depression and the collapse of their colonial empire. Most of the world saw France as the weakest of the Allies, France proved them wrong. With the beginning of the Trente Glorieuses, France’s economy recovered and became the largest in western Europe. She forged alliances with other European countries, leading to the formation of the European Union. Now in the 21st century France is a pillar of stability in an uncertain time. As the leading nation in Europe she must stand firm, or risk the continent descending into chaos once more."
 CHI_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "The end of the Second World War brought the end of the Century of Humiliation imposed on China by foreign invaders. Instead she suffered from nearly half a century of dictatorship and division. Separated by the lines of battle drawn by the Cold War and further divided by her leaders. But the Chinese people endured. They raised the flag of the Xinhai Revolution once more and brought both presidents and chairmen to heel. Now united and free like the empires of old, China is ready to take her rightful place among the world powers."
 JAP_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "The last century saw both the rise and the fall of the Japanese Empire. Brought under the heel of the American occupiers, Japan was rebuilt and strengthened, becoming a key ally in the fight against communism. But resentment for what had been taken was never far below the surface. With the end of the Cold War came the end of the parasitic relationship between servant and master that Japan suffered under. Now free to decide her own destiny, Japan has decided to take back what she has lost. The new century will be heralded by the Rising Sun."
 OTHER_RISING_EAGLE_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Cold War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
