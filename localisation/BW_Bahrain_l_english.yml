 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_HASAN_MUSHAIMA_DESC:0 "Hasan Mushaima is one of the most prominent democratic activists in the Arab world. He was one of the leaders of the Uprising of Dignity in 1994, a five-year long revolt that shook the Bahraini political landscape. In 1999 the new Emir ended the revolt by instituting democratic reforms and calling a nationwide referendum on a new constitution. Despite this Mushaima continued to be arrested and harassed by the authorities. Tensions came to a head again after the election in 2006, where the opposition won a clear majority. Despite this Emir Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa continued to increase his power and frequently ignored the opposition-controlled legislature. Peaceful protests began to break out across the country and were soon met by force. In response thousands marched on the Pearl Monument in central Manama and occupied the square. The opposition in the Council of Representatives resigned to join the protestors, with Mushaima becoming their most prominent leader. He brought together liberal democratic activists, leftists, Islamists and Arab nationalists in a large coalition against the monarchy. As the Emir was losing confidence every day he sent for support from the Gulf Cooperation Council, but it was too late. Elements of the army turned against him and allowed protestors to occupy the Al-Qudaibiya Palace, forcing the government to move to the Al-Sakhir Royal Palace in the western deserts of the country. With relief from the Gulf States unable to land the Emir was forced to leave the country, setting up a new government in Cairo. As the unofficial head of the protest movement, Hasan Mushaima soon found himself as the leader of the first revolutionary government in the western Persian Gulf, leading a diverse coalition against the hostile forces of the Peninsula Shield."
