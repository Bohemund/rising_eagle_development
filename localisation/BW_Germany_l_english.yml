 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_OSKAR_LAFONTAINE_DESC:0 "Oskar Lafontaine began his political career as mayor of Saarbrücken, where he became known for his criticism of Chancellor Rainer Barzel’s support for deploying NATO missiles in Germany. This caught the attention of the SPD leadership, who chose him as their nominee in the 1990 election. The election was held three years after German reunification, as the government of Helmut Kohl struggled with an economic recession in the east and an increasing tax burden on the west. The two candidates ran neck-in-neck until a botched assassination attempt left Lafontaine in critical condition for several days. This garnered him enough sympathy to swing the vote in his favor. After assuming the office of Chancellor of Germany, he immediately began to remedy the economic troubles by strengthening job security and investing in the east. Despite this he was unable to prevent the economic recession that struck the country in 1991, and lost the next election Wolfgang Schäuble. He initially considered leaving politics, but returned to government as Minister of Finance after the election of Gerhard Schröder in 1998. His political and personal differences with Schröder eventually led to him leaving the government and retiring from politics. His retirement proved short, as Schröder lost the next federal election to Roland Koch and Lafontaine returned to campaign for the SPD. Schröder’s resignation led to Lafontaine being elected leader of the SPD and then chosen as their candidate for the 2006 election. His second election was one of the most polarised in recent history, as he brought the former SED into government for the first time since reunification. With his second term coming to an end, Oskar Lafontaine has hinted that his health may force him to retire from politics."
