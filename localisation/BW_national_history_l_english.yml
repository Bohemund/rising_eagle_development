 decision_event.1.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1952 was the 42nd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won a close victory over sitting Democratic President Harry S. Truman, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932. The incumbent President entered the primaries with moderate support but was challenged by populist Senator Estes Kefauver. Truman managed to race ahead once the Allied Offensive began in September, breaking the long stalemate south of the 38th parallel that had characterized much of the Korean War. The President rallied the party to his side and was nominated on the second presidential ballot of the 1952 Democratic National Convention, defeating Kefauver, Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, and other candidates. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Governor Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young anti-Communist Senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate.\n\nEisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, "I Like Ike." Eisenhower and Truman remained close throughout the race but in the end Ike’s popularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 51% of the popular vote to Truman’s 48%. The electoral vote however came very close, within a 10 elector margin. Eisenhower carried most of the Midwest, northeast and west which managed to make up for the Democrats’ strong base in the South. Republicans also won control of both houses of Congress."

 decision_event.2.d:0 "The Korean Peace Agreement, known commonly around the world as the 'surrender at Hyesan' was the unconditional surrender of all forces belonging to the proclaimed Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on May 28th, 1953. In the weeks preceding, a small remaining number of troops were isolated within the northeastern tip of Korea, notably after the fall of Kanggye to Allied forces. At Hyesan the last remaining North Korean commanders and politicians waited and held the ground so that troops could be evacuated across the Yalu River into the People’s Republic of China. On the twenty-eighth of May General Mark Clark's troops surrounded the city, and the following day acting President Kim Tu-bong signed an agreement that formally terminated all remaining DPRK forces on the Korean peninsula and put the entire region under the control of the Republic of Korea, even though they were already recognized as the legitimate Korean government by most of the UN. The surrender at Hyesan was not just a victory in conflict for America, but also a major propaganda success, with the image of victorious Allied soldiers being spread far and wide across the world. America had won its first victory against their new enemy, Communism."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "The 1953 Iranian coup D'état was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States. Mossadegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation and to limit the company's control over Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to rule more firmly as monarch."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The 1954 Guatemalan coup D'état was a covert operation carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Arbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Arbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America."

 decision_event.9.d:0 "The Suez Crisis was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aims were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalized the canal. In the summer of 1954 a number of attacks on British and American civilians had turned opinion against Egyptian nationalism and strengthened the ties between the Israel and the United States. On 29 October, Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai. Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. On 5 November, Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they did block the canal to all shipping. After the fighting had started the Soviet Union and the United Nations attempted to pressure the three nations from withdrawing, but America defended their actions as peacekeeping. President Eisenhower had to step in and hold a speech at the UN which would eventually lead to a ceasefire. The Suez Canal was closed from October 1956 until May 1957. Israel fulfilled most its objectives, such as attaining freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran and creating instability in Egypt which would eventually lead to the resignation of Nasser. As a result of the conflict, Israel was also able to maintain military control over the Sinai and ownership of the canal was transferred back to the Suez Canal Company."

The incumbent President, Republican Dwight Eisenhower successfully ran for re-election. Eisenhower, who had first become famous for his military leadership in World War II, had become far more popular than expected due to his successful, tough stance on Communism. He was unopposed at the Republican National Convention and faced a broad national following even greater than his first election campaign. Senator Stuart Symington defeated Adlai Stevenson, Governor William Harriman and other candidates to seize the Democratic Party's nomination, with the backing of Harry Truman and the Democratic establishment. Symington appealed to the legacy of Truman and Roosevelt, calling for a significant increase in government spending on social programs and warning that more years under a Republican administration could lead to a second Great Depression. In the end, Symington's attempt at recreating the “New Deal” populist movement of the 1930’s was ineffective against the sheer popularity and likeableness of Eisenhower, handing a second term to the President on election night. The incumbent maintained support with Republicans and made significant gains among Democrats, especially white urban Southerners and Northern Catholics."

 decision_event.6.d:0 "The Civil Rights Movement was a decades-long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already held. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans. Moderates in the movement worked with Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation overturning discriminatory practices. President Kennedy's Civil Rights Act of 1963 expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. Successive legislation rapidly ended legal inequality in the United States, most notably during the Kennedy Presidency and his successor Nelson Rockefeller's first years. From 1962 through 1971, a wave of inner-city riots in black communities undercut support from the white middle class, but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from about 1963 to 1982, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence, and instead demanding that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency be built in the black community. Charismatic universally recognised leader of the civil rights movement Martin Luther King played a significant role in inspiring millions around the nation, and his assassination attempt is seen as the final blow against pro-segregation movements."

In a closely contested election, Democrat John F. Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican Vice President Richard Nixon. This was the first election in which all fifty states participated and the first in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for another term. Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Kennedy, a Massachusetts senator on the other hand battled against a range of adversaries. Most notably the experienced Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who Kennedy would ask to serve has his running mate. The issue of the Cold War dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kennedy safely seized the highest number of electoral college votes, beating Nixon by nearly 150 electorates. The popular vote however was one of the closest in recent history, the difference between both candidates being less than 1%. The issue was complicated by unpledged electors from Mississippi and Alabama casting their votes for Senator Harry F. Byrd, a southern conservative. Kennedy championed his slogan of the “New Frontier”, which would include the elimination of poverty and racial injustice, the expansion of infrastructure  and education as well as science and space research. The young senator was charismatic, a strong debater and managed his campaign well, focusing on swing states whereas Nixon campaigned all over the country. Kennedy also had the support of the big-city bosses who increased turnout in urban areas and Johnson who held the South. The Democrats also held the Senate while gaining the majority of seats in Congress."

 decision_event.8.d:0 "The Cuban Missile Crisis was a 19-day confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union concerning American ballistic missile deployment in Italy and Turkey with consequent Soviet ballistic missile deployment in Cuba. In response to a failed counterrevolutionary coup in Havana, sponsored by the United States and Haiti, Soviet leader Malenkov decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during telephone calls between Malenkov and Fidel Castro in March 1961 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that Summer. President Kennedy ordered the US Navy to establish a blockade, preventing any further Soviet missiles from reaching the island. Kennedy is said to have stated to Lyndon Johnson after the fact that the blockade was a deliberate provocation, he wanted to test the Soviets following the American triumph in the Korean War. The President announced to a White House press conference that the United States would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba. Demands were subsequently made that the remaining missiles be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union. After a long period of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between President Kennedy and Malenkov. On August 12, 1961, the Soviets agreed to dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again. In turn the United States agreed that it would dismantle their missiles in Turkey, but the missiles in Italy were never mentioned. The crisis remains a low point for Soviet supremacy in the Cold War, giving Washington an edge that would last for at least another decade and prompting a political crisis in Moscow."

 decision_event.20.d:0 "The Alliance for Progress, initiated by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, aimed to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The initiative supported an annual increase in per capita income, the elimination of adult illiteracy, the establishment of democratic governments, efficient economic planning. It required the participating countries to draw up comprehensive plans for national development and pledge large amounts of capital investment to the program. The alliance charter also included a clause encouraged by US policy makers that committed Latin American governments to the promotion "of conditions that will encourage the flow of foreign investments" to the region. Because of the program, economic assistance to Latin America nearly tripled between fiscal year 1960 and 1961. Between 1962 and 1967 the US supplied billions of dollars of investments to Latin America. However, the amount of aid did not equal the net transfer of resources and development as Latin American countries still had to pay off their debt to the US and other first world countries. Additionally, profits from the investments usually returned to the US, with profits frequently exceeding new investment. The alliance achieved short-term success but economic aid and investment dropped sharply when Nelson Rockefeller entered the White House, and by the early 1970s the program was widely viewed as a failure."

The following day, with the military already in control of the country, the Brazilian Congress came out in support of the coup and endorsed it by declaring vacant the office of the presidency. The coup put an end to the government of Goulart, a member of the Brazilian Labour Party. President Jânio Quadros resigned in 1961 and was succeeded by Vice President Goulart. He took office with full powers, and during his rule several problems in Brazilian politics became evident, as well as disputes in the context of the Cold War, which helped destabilize his government. Goulart’s proposed Basic Reforms Plan had the potential to socialize the profits of large companies to ensure a better quality of life for most Brazilians, but was labelled as a "socialist threat" by right-wing sectors of society and of the military, which organized major demonstrations against the government. The coup brought to Brazil a military regime politically aligned to the interests of the United States government. This regime lasted until 1991, when it was replaced by the new government of the South American Union."

 decision_event.10.d:0 "The Gulf of Tonkin incident was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in Indochina. It involved two separate confrontations between North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. On August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. Maddox fired three warning shots and the North Vietnamese boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire. One U.S. aircraft was damaged, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats were damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were killed, with six more wounded. The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted President John F. Kennedy the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by "communist aggression". The resolution served as Kennedy's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam, and is thus seen as the start of the Vietnam War."

Incumbent Democratic President John F. Kennedy defeated William Scranton, the Republican nominee. Kennedy easily defeated segregationist Governor George Wallace of Alabama in the primary before being nominated on the first ballot of the Democratic Convention. In one of the most contested Republican primaries in recent memory Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania, a moderate Republican, defeated conservative Senator Barry Goldwater after Nelson Rockefeller had dropped out of the race. Scranton entered the race late and had to fight tooth and nail at the Democratic Convention to win over delegates, arguing that Goldwater’s conservatism made him unelectable by a majority of the electorate. Kennedy championed his passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1963, and his campaign continued to advocate for his anti-poverty programs collectively known as the “New Frontier.” Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was one of the most fervent supporters of this program, having been one of its principal architects. Scranton campaigned on his principal issue of education reform and integration, a program he had already implemented in Pennsylvania. Scranton argued that education was the right method to defeat Communism and he advocated extending his policies to the rest of the states. With Kennedy’s massive popularity the Democrats managed to hold their ground and even gain many states, including Maine which had not voted Democratic since 1916. This was the first presidential election after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1963, which had led to mass enfranchisement of racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. The election defeated many conservative Republican congressmen, giving Kennedy a majority that could overcome the conservative coalition which had hindered many reforms during his first term."

Kennedy in his acceptance speech in the 1960 United States presidential election to the Democratic National Convention as the slogan to inspire America to support him. The phrase developed into a label for his administration's domestic and foreign programs. The main goal was the total elimination of poverty and racial injustice, the expansion of education and the establishment of a space program to rival that of the Soviet Union. The Kennedy administration launched new major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation. The program and its initiatives were subsequently promoted by him and fellow Democrats in Congress in the 1960s and years following. The New Frontier in scope and sweep resembled the New Deal domestic agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Kennedy was greatly aided by Vice President Johnson, who had created large parts of the program. After the Democratic sweep of the House and Senate in 1964 the program could be implemented with more certainty but many anti-war Democrats complained that spending on the Vietnam War choked off the New Frontier. The programs continued to expand under the subsequent Rockefeller administration and eventually also under his brother Ted Kennedy."

One of the most tumultuous periods in the country's modern history, it was the commencement of Suharto's 34-year presidency. Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and Indonesian Communist Party. By 1965, the Communists extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army. On 30 September 1965, six of the military's most senior officers were killed in an action by the so-called 30 September Movement, a communist group from within the armed forces. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta. Anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on a violent purge of communists throughout the country, killing an estimated half million people and destroying the Communist Party, which was officially blamed for the crisis. The politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Indonesian parliament named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suharto's pro-Western "New Order" stabilised the economy but continued the policies of Pancasila."

Beginning in 1950, American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina. Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. The Viet Cong, a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North, fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region, while the People's Army of Vietnam engaged in more conventional warfare, and had launched armed struggles from 1959 onward. U.S. involvement escalated in 1960 under President Kennedy, with troop levels gradually surging from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. By 1964 that number had nearly doubled. Deployment escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a U.S. destroyer clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Kennedy broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000. Every year onward there was significant build-up despite little progress, with Robert McNamara, one of the principal architects of the war, beginning to express doubts of victory by the end of 1966. After the Tet Offensive of 1968, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam was pushed back, leading to increased anti-war sentiment in America. President Rockefeller initially sought to continue fighting the war with new leadership but decided to withdraw in order to placate the anti-war movement and divert resources elsewhere. The three sides signed the Paris Peace Accords in 1973 and America withdrew. However peace between North and South did not last. The conflict soon rekindled and Saigon fell the following year, beginning the transition into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam."

McCarthy entered the primaries against Hubert Humphrey, who had the support of former president John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and won a surprise upset in New Hampshire. Robert Kennedy entered the race just in time for the Indiana primary and made strong gains, becoming the frontrunner at the time of the convention. Kennedy and McCarthy combined their tickets and delegates which gave them enough to surpass Humphrey, who had been gathering unpledged delegates. After Kennedy was assassinated McCarthy took control of the campaign, but the Rockefeller campaign had no trouble portraying him as a dangerous radical who was too weak on communism. Rockefeller did however face an unexpected challenge in Ronald Reagan. The California Governor was upset with two liberal candidates and launched a serious campaign for the presidency.\n\nOn election night it was clear that Rockefeller had won in a landslide, sweeping nearly every state outside the Great Lakes and the Deep South. Reagan came second, winning his home state and number of others through conservative turnout. McCarthy was left with nearly nothing.

 decision_event.21.d:0 "The 1960 Turkish coup d’état was the first coup d’état in Turkey. It was staged by 38 young low-ranking military officers, not obeying the chain of command. Critical footholds were first established by their access to guns and men, leading to the disablement of the chain of command. They took control of the government by arresting President Celal Bayar and cabinet members, the army by forcing 235 generals and 3500 officers into early retirement, the justice system by detaining 520 judges. It was orchestrated by Alparslan Türkeş and eventually led by Cemal Gürsel against the Democrat Party. The incident was caused by years of socio-economic hardship. Colonel Alparslan Türkeş stated his allegiance to NATO in his address to the nation, Türkeş declared the coup over radio, which ultimately announced “the end of one period in Turkish history, and usher in a new one”. The following trials resulted in the execution of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Minister of Finance Hasan Polatkan and the imprisonment of President Celal Bayar because of old age. A new constitution was written to replace the old one from 1924, it was approved by 61.7% percent of the votes. A month after the execution of Menderes and other members of the Turkish government, general elections were held on 15 October 1961. The administrative authority was returned to civilians, but the military continued to dominate the political scene until October 1965. General İsmet İnönü held the office of Prime Minister for the third time from 1961 to 1965."

 decision_event.22.t:0 "Operation Condor"
 decision_event.22.d:0 "Operation Condor was a United States–backed campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, officially implemented in 1975 by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America. The program, nominally intended to eradicate communist or Soviet influence and ideas, was created to suppress active or potential opposition movements against the participating governments' neoliberal economic policies, which sought to reverse the economic policies of the previous era. Victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals and suspected guerillas. Condor's key members were the governments in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Colombia and Brazil. The United States government provided technical support and supplied military aid to the participants during the John F. Kennedy, Rockefeller, Ashbrook and Ted Kennedy administrations. Such support was frequently routed through the Central Intelligence Agency."

 decision_event.23.d:0 "The Mexican general election of 2000 was the 18th election to be held in Mexico since the Revolution of 1917. It was held on Sunday, July 2, 2000, and was held to announce the new President of the Republic to serve a six-year term. Due to Mexican rules on term limits, the previous president, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, could not run in the election, and so the Institutional Revolutionary Party chose Mexican economist Francisco Labastida to take up the banner of the PRI and ensure the dominance of the party for 6 more years. Due to the rejuvenated Synarchist movement, fuelled by continued American influence in Mexican politics and growing nationalism and populism, the Social Democrats attempted to forge a coalition with the Synarchists against the political establishment. This “Alliance for Mexico” was made up of the PRD, the Labor Party, the Party of the Nationalist Society, and the National Synarchist Party, an anti-establishment pact that united both the left and right against the PRI and the PAN. With nationalists and PRI dissidents being attracted by this new coalition, the PAN and PRI began to lose numbers in the polls to the Alliance for Mexico, and the ability of a non-PRI party to win the election became more and more possible. Vicente Fox, the candidate of the National Action Party, was attacked for his views on American foreign policy and his neoliberal economic policies. The opposition slandered him as an American puppet who would bring the country into NATO, and would strengthen the already-powerful American businesses currently acting in Mexico. The polls leading up to the election were divisive - and the election appeared to be going anyone’s way, but eventually, the PRI kept its 83-year hold over the Mexican political system by a margin of 1 million votes, and Francisco Labastida became the 18th president of Mexico."

 decision_event.24.d:0 "The 1973 Chilean coup d'état was a watershed moment in both the history of Chile and the Cold War. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the opposition-controlled Congress of Chile and the socialist President Salvador Allende, as well as economic warfare ordered by US President Nelson Rockefeller, Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police. The military deposed Allende's Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially the Communist and socialist parties. Allende's appointed army chief, Augusto Pinochet, rose to supreme power within a year of the coup, formally assuming power in late-1974. The United States government, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup, promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power. During the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup, Allende gave his final speech, in which he vowed to stay in the presidential palace, refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation. Direct witness accounts of Allende's death agree that he killed himself in the palace. Before the coup, Chile had been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability for decades; whilst the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and Caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932."

 decision_event.25.d:0 "The 1976 United States presidential election was the 48th quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 2, 1976. Senator John M. Ashbrook of Ohio defeated Jimmy Carter of Georgia. Rockefeller’s two challengers from the ‘72 primary met again, this time running neck and neck throughout most of the primary until Ashbrook won an upset victory in California. The convention was deeply divided between liberals and conservatives, but eventually Ashbrook was nominated on the fifth ballot. In a surprising move Ashbrook offered the spot of Vice President to McCloskey, who accepted after a long time of deliberation. The Democrats nominated the little-known Jimmy Carter, former Governor of Georgia. Carter was a moderate and presented himself as a political outsider, exactly what the Democratic Party needed to “reinvent” itself after the defeats of ‘68 and ‘72.\n\nThe campaign was tense, the issue of the Vietnam War was still fresh in the minds of the people and Ashbrook criticized President Rockefeller for his withdrawal. He also called for further aid to the Republic of China and for support to the revolutionaries in the White Flower Revolution which broke out that spring. His tough stance on communism was popular, but his very conservative social policies were often criticized by Carter and other liberals. On election night Ashbrook secured a confident majority of electors, sweeping the West Coast and winning most of the Midwest and the South, which was expected to go for Carter."

 decision_event.26.d:0 "The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis was an armed conflict waged between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China in the early months of 1976. It began when the PRC bombarded Kinmen and Matsu Island, as a continuation of the 1958 Strait Crisis. The RoC soldiers returned fire and the navy was sent to protect the straits. Premier Peng Dehuai accused the RoC of being the aggressor and blamed them for funding rebels inside mainland China. The PRC assembled forces in Fujian and Guangdong, in response the US rebased troops from Okinawa to the island of Taiwan and sent the Pacific Fleet to protect the straits. What followed was a two-week long standoff between PRC and ROC forces, aided by the US. Peng had clearly sought to expand the influence of the PRC, with the eventual goal of taking Taiwan itself. He was forced to back down, facing increasing pressure from both inside the country and the international community. The bombardments stopped and both sides returned to the status-quo, but this was a defeat for the PRC. The United States would increase their troop presence on Taiwan and Japan following the incident, which would prove instrumental to the Nationalists when the Chinese Civil War resumed."

 decision_event.27.d:0 "The White Flower Revolution was a popular uprising against the government of the People’s Republic of China that started on the 4th of June, 1976. It began as a coup by reformists inside the Chinese Communist Party who attempted to oust Premier Peng Dehuai and Chairman Zhu De. The coup was faced with stiff resistance but forces loyal to the Premier were unable to suppress the putschists and the incident turned into an all-out battle in Beijing. The Soviet Union began to fund the rebels, in an effort to weaken their main communist rival and install a government more accepting of Soviet leadership. Forces would be brought in from South China in order to deal with the rebellion. Peng once again accused the United States and the Republic of China of funding the rebels and denounced them in a spectacular speech, which led to China severing all diplomatic ties with both nations. President Chiang Ching-kuo saw this as an attempt to violate the unofficial armistice that had existed since 50’s and prepared the country for war. The Kuomintang launched an invasion of South China in early August, shortly after the Yangtze Revolt began. Uprisings in major cities led to the People’s Liberation Army being pushed back. The rebels united as the National Democratic Army, bolstered by significant aid from the US. The PLA, assailed from many fronts and pressured by defections eventually collapsed and Premier Peng surrendered to the rebel forces. The revolution claimed an estimated 20 million lives and inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on China. The revolution and the Chinese Civil War officially ended when the reformists, now known as the Chinese Socialist Front, the National Democratic Army and the Kuomintang formed a coalition government and Deng Xiaoping was inaugurated as president of the Provisional Authority of the Republic of China."

 decision_event.28.d:0 "The Six-Day War was fought between 5 and 10 June 1967 by the United States and Israel against the neighboring states of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. In the months prior to the war, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel had been guaranteed the right to ship through the Straits of Tiran following the Suez Crisis and Prime Minister Menachem Begin warned that closing the straits would be a cause for war. Egypt was suffering from instability after the defeat in 1956 and President Ali Sabri, an avowed socialist, enlisted the help of the Soviet Union in training and equipping the Egyptian army. In May Sabri announced that the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels and then mobilised its Egyptian forces along its border with Israel. On 5 June, Israel launched a series of preemptive airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. The Egyptians were caught by surprise, and nearly the entire Egyptian air force was destroyed with few Israeli losses. Simultaneously, Israel launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip and the Sinai. After some initial resistance, Sabri ordered the evacuation of the Sinai. Israeli forces rushed westward in pursuit of the Egyptians, inflicted heavy losses, and conquered the Sinai. Jordan had entered into a defense pact with Egypt a week before the war began; the agreement envisaged that Jordan would not take an offensive role but would attempt to tie down Israeli forces to prevent them making territorial gains. On the initiative of Prime Minister Rashid Karami, Lebanon entered the war and launched an unsuccessful attack on the USS Liberty which caused the United States to enter the war in the third day. Israel was able to occupy the Sinai, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and small parts southern Lebanon. The Arab coalition was forced to sign a ceasefire, ending the conflict in a clear victory for the Israel and the United States."

Following the secession of the Baltic Republics Grigory Romanov’s hold on power was greatly weakened. The regional governments were effectively operating independently without the General Secretary’s authority. Russian President Nikolai Ryzhkov condemned Romanov’s coup against the Politburo and Romanov in turn denounced him and demanded his arrest. As the army command was divided on who to support fighting broke out in Moscow when both sides attempted occupy Red Square. In response to this Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev called a meeting of the constituent leaders of all republics in the Soviet Union. The republics were scrambling to pull free from the union, like the Baltics had already done. On May 1st the presidents of all republics met in Almaty where the declaration denouncing the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR was drafted. It was signed by all attending delegates and on that day the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist. The union was replaced by a small inter-governmental organization, which would soon be dissolved as well. This was condemned by the remnants of the Soviet government but they lacked the power to dispute the declaration. A week later Romanov was forced to dissolve his government and resign as General Secretary. Together with many Soviet politicians Romanov would move to Karakalpakstan, the only republic which did not recognize the declaration."

 decision_event.30.d:0 "The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic election of 1986 was the first democratic election in independent Russia. It was held on Sunday, November 17th on the anniversary of the October Revolution. Nikolay Travkin of the newly established Constitutional Democratic Party defeated the incumbent Nikolai Ryzhkov of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Russia experienced a great deal of instability during the first months of independence. The legal status of everything from property and industry to borders were not well established. Ryzhkov chose to open the borders to former republics and aimed to strengthen the economic ties between them. Not everyone agreed and many republics were quickly descending into economic recession. Meanwhile the liberalization brought by Gorbachev and Ryzhkov led to increasing demands for democratic elections. Facing continued demonstrations the president called for elections to take place by the end of the year. The process can only be described as chaotic. Many hopefuls put forth their candidacy but only a few were supported by the established parties. Nikolay Travkin, a little known politician turned populist launched the Constitutional Democratic Party, aimed at restoring civil liberties and initiating Russia’s transition into a market economy. The Communist Party struggled with internal issues between reformists and hardliners, which prompted a faction of the party to support Oleg Shenin’s independent candidacy. Faced with unrest and vote splitting Travkin secured a plurality of the popular vote and was voted in as the second president of Russia. Subsequent legislative elections would establish the so called “Cadet Party” as the foremost political force in the Russian Supreme Soviet."
