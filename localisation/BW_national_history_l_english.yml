 decision_event.1.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1952 was the 42nd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won a close victory over sitting Democratic President Harry S. Truman, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932. The incumbent President Truman sought a second full term, but was challenged by populist Senator Estes Kefauver. Despite some opposition the President rallied the party to his side and emerged victorious on the first ballot of the National Convention, defeating Kefauver and Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia. The Republican nomination was primarily contested between Douglas MacArthur, conservative Governor Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft and MacArthur at the National Convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young anti-Communist Senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate. Eisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, "I Like Ike.". In one of the closest elections in modern history Eisenhower prevailed over Truman by a small margin in both the popular and electoral vote, despite the incumbent’s victorious leadership in both World War II and the Korean War."

In the weeks preceding, the UN Forces had launched a final offensive into North Korea - rapidly advancing towards the Yalu River. The “Home-by-Christmas Offensive” ended at Hyesan, where the remaining North Korean commanders and politicians were evacuating across the river into the People’s Republic of China. On December 23rd, General Douglas MacArthur’s troops surrounded the city and the following day acting DPRK President Kim Tu-bong signed an agreement that formally terminated all remaining North Korean forces and surrendered them to UN custody. The entire region was officially put under control of the Republic of Korea, though they were already recognized as the legitimate Korean government by the UN. The “victory at Hyesan” was not just a victory in conflict for America, but also a major propaganda success, with the image of victorious Allied soldiers being spread far and wide across the world. America had won its first victory against their new enemy, communism."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "The 1953 Iranian coup D'état was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States. Mossadegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation and to limit the company's control over Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to rule more firmly as monarch."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The 1954 Guatemalan coup D'état was a covert operation carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Arbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Arbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America."

 decision_event.9.d:0 "The Suez Crisis was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aim of the invasion was to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalized the canal. The invasion began on October 29th, to which Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. In response the two western powers landed troops along the Suez Canal on November 5th. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they blocked the canal to all shipping. The three allies had attained a number of their military objectives, but the canal was useless. Heavy political pressure from the United States and the USSR led to a withdrawal. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had strongly warned Britain not to invade; he threatened serious damage to the British financial system by selling the US government's pound sterling bonds. Israel fulfilled some of its objectives, such as attaining freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran, which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Despite this success the invasion was a decisive diplomatic victory for Nasser, who secured support from the Soviet Union while strengthening his position as President of Egypt."

The incumbent President, Republican Dwight Eisenhower successfully ran for re-election. Eisenhower, who had first become famous for his military leadership in World War II, had become far more popular than expected due to his successful, tough stance on communism. He was unopposed in the primaries and had a broad national following even greater than his first election campaign. Governor William Averell Harriman, with the support of Harry Truman, defeated Adlai Stevenson and other candidates to seize the Democratic Party's nomination, calling for a 'New Wave' against well-established social policies. In the end, Harriman's attempt at creating a populist movement while clearly being a member of the elite establishment doomed the Democratic Party in 1956, handing a second term to President Eisenhower on election night. The incumbent maintained support with Republicans and made significant gains among Democrats, especially white urban Southerners and Northern Catholics."

 decision_event.6.d:0 "The civil rights movement was a decades-long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already held. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans. Moderates in the movement worked with Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation overturning discriminatory practices. President Kennedy's Civil Rights Act of 1965 expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. Successive legislation rapidly ended legal inequality in the United States, most notably during the Kennedy Presidency and his successor Nelson Rockefeller's first years. From 1962 through 1971, a wave of inner-city riots in black communities undercut support from the white middle class, but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from about 1963 to 1982, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence, and instead demanding that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency be built in the black community. Charismatic universally recognised leader of the civil rights movement Martin Luther King played a significant role in inspiring millions around the nation, and his assassination attempt is seen as the final blow against pro-segregation movements."

In a closely contested election, Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican Vice President Richard Nixon. This was the first election in which all fifty states participated and the first in which the incumbent president was ineligible to run for another term. Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Kennedy on the other hand battled against a range of adversaries. Most notably the experienced Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who after losing the nomination to Kennedy was chosen to be his running mate. The issue of the Cold War dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kennedy presented himself as candidate most prepared to deal with the threat of the Soviet Union, this was despite him being critiqued as “too soft on communism” in his early senate career. He had even been the victim of an assassination attempt, with potential assassin David Ferrie accusing him of being a “Marxist sympathiser.” This made any accusation of weakness seem little more than a right-wing conspiracy. In the end Kennedy safely seized the highest number of electoral college votes, nearly double that of Nixon. At age forty-six, Kennedy became the youngest person ever elected to the presidency."

In response to a failed counterrevolutionary coup in Havana, sponsored by the United States and Haiti, Soviet leader Georgy Malenkov agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during telephone calls between Malenkov and Fidel Castro in March 1961 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that Summer. President Kennedy ordered the US Navy to establish a blockade and announced to a White House press conference that the United States would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba. Demands were subsequently made that the remaining missiles be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union. After a long period of tense negotiations an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Malenkov. On August 11, 1962, the Soviet Union agreed to dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, in turn the United States agreed that it would dismantle their missiles in Italy and Turkey. The crisis remains a high point of tension in the Cold War but the subsequent de-escalation is often attributed to Kennedy’s determination to achieve peace in Cuba."

 decision_event.20.d:0 "The Alliance for Progress, initiated by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, aimed to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The initiative supported an annual increase in per capita income, the elimination of adult illiteracy, the establishment of democratic governments and efficient economic planning. Because of the program, economic assistance to Latin America nearly tripled between fiscal year 1960 and 1961. Between 1962 and 1967 the U.S. supplied billions of dollars of investments to Latin America. However, the amount of aid did not equal the net transfer of resources and development as Latin American countries still had to pay off their debt to the US and other first world countries. Additionally, profits from the investments usually returned to the US, with profits frequently exceeding new investment. The alliance achieved short-term success during Kennedy’s presidency but economic aid and investment dropped during the subsequent Republican administrations. The project was eventually revived in 1981 by President Ted Kennedy, who maintained close relations to Latin America during the end of the Cold War."

The following day, with the military already in control of the country, the Brazilian Congress came out in support of the coup and endorsed it by declaring vacant the office of the presidency. The coup put an end to the government of Goulart, a member of the Brazilian Labour Party. President Jânio Quadros resigned in 1961 and was succeeded by Vice President Goulart. He took office with full powers, and during his rule several problems in Brazilian politics became evident, as well as disputes in the context of the Cold War, which helped destabilize his government. Goulart’s proposed Basic Reforms Plan had the potential to socialize the profits of large companies to ensure a better quality of life for most Brazilians, but was labelled as a "socialist threat" by right-wing sectors of society and of the military, which organized major demonstrations against the government. The coup brought to Brazil a military regime politically aligned to the interests of the United States government. This regime lasted until 1991, when it was replaced by the new government of the South American Union."

Lucien Conein, the Central Intelligence Agency's liaison between the U.S. Embassy and the coup planners, told them that the U.S. would not intervene to stop it. Conein also provided funds to the coup leaders. The coup was led by General Duong Van Minh and started on 1 November. It proceeded smoothly as many loyalist leaders were captured after being caught off-guard and casualties were light. Diem was captured and executed the next day along with his brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu.

Presenting himself as a moderate compromise candidate, Rhodes managed to win over the party at the national convention, arguing that Goldwater’s conservatism made him unelectable by a majority of the country. Kennedy championed the expansion of the New Frontier, anti-poverty programs and civil rights legislation. With Kennedy’s massive popularity the Democrats managed to hold their ground and even gain in many states.

The slogan eventually developed into a label for his administration's domestic and foreign programs. The main goal was the total elimination of poverty and racial injustice, the expansion of education and the establishment of a space program to rival that of the Soviet Union. The Kennedy administration launched new major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation. The program and its initiatives were subsequently promoted by him and fellow Democrats in Congress in the 1960s and years following. The New Frontier in scope and sweep resembled the New Deal domestic agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Kennedy was greatly aided by Vice President Johnson, who had created large parts of the program. After the Democratic sweep of the House and Senate in 1964 the program could be implemented with more certainty but many anti-war Democrats complained that spending on the Vietnam War choked off the New Frontier. The programs continued to expand under the subsequent Rockefeller administration and eventually also under his brother Ted Kennedy."

One of the most tumultuous periods in the country's modern history, it was the commencement of Suharto's 34-year presidency. Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and Indonesian Communist Party. By 1965, the Communists extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army. On 30 September 1965, six of the military's most senior officers were killed in an action by the so-called 30 September Movement, a communist group from within the armed forces. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta. Anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on a violent purge of communists throughout the country, killing an estimated half million people and destroying the Communist Party, which was officially blamed for the crisis. The politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Indonesian parliament named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suharto's pro-Western "New Order" stabilised the economy but continued the policies of Pancasila."

The offensive was countrywide and well coordinated, taking the South Vietnamese army by surprise. Attempts by the south to regroup were largely unsuccessful and by August the South Vietnamese army had collapsed on all fronts except the Mekong Delta. Saigon was surrounded by northern troops who began a shelling of the city, destroying the airport and trapping the civilians trying to escape. Though President Kennedy had largely withdrawn all U.S. advisors and military personnel in 1965 a small force remained to protect the American embassy and any remaining U.S. citizens. This force began Operation Fall, evacuating all remaining personnel and thousands of civilians associated with the southern regime. On September 23rd the North Vietnamese army occupied the city and raised their flag over the presidential palace, naming the city Ho Chí Minh City, after the North Vietnamese president Ho Chí Minh.

They took control of the government by arresting President Celal Bayar and cabinet members, the army by forcing 235 generals and 3500 officers into early retirement, the justice system by detaining 520 judges. It was orchestrated by Alparslan Türkeş and eventually led by Cemal Gürsel against the Democrat Party. The incident was caused by years of socio-economic hardship. Colonel Alparslan Türkeş stated his allegiance to NATO in his address to the nation, Türkeş declared the coup over radio, which ultimately announced “the end of one period in Turkish history, and usher in a new one”. The following trials resulted in the execution of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Minister of Finance Hasan Polatkan and the imprisonment of President Celal Bayar because of old age. A new constitution was written to replace the old one from 1924, it was approved by 61.7% percent of the votes.

Due to Mexican rules on term limits, the previous president, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, could not run in the election, and so the Institutional Revolutionary Party chose Mexican economist Francisco Labastida to take up the banner of the PRI and ensure the dominance of the party for 6 more years. Due to the rejuvenated Synarchist movement, fuelled by continued American influence in Mexican politics and growing nationalism and populism, the Social Democrats attempted to forge a coalition with the Synarchists against the political establishment. This “Alliance for Mexico” was made up of the PRD, the Labor Party, the Party of the Nationalist Society, and the National Synarchist Party, an anti-establishment pact that united both the left and right against the PRI and the PAN. With nationalists and PRI dissidents being attracted by this new coalition, the PAN and PRI began to lose numbers in the polls to the Alliance for Mexico, and the ability of a non-PRI party to win the election became more and more possible. Vicente Fox, the candidate of the National Action Party, was attacked for his views on American foreign policy and his neoliberal economic policies. The opposition slandered him as an American puppet who would bring the country into NATO, and would strengthen the already-powerful American businesses currently acting in Mexico. The polls leading up to the election were divisive - and the election appeared to be going anyone’s way, but eventually, the PRI kept its 83-year hold over the Mexican political system by a margin of 1 million votes, and Francisco Labastida became the 18th president of Mexico."

 decision_event.24.d:0 "The 1973 Chilean coup d'état was a watershed moment in both the history of Chile and the Cold War. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the opposition-controlled Congress of Chile and the socialist President Salvador Allende, as well as economic warfare ordered by US President Nelson Rockefeller, Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police. The military deposed Allende's Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially the Communist and socialist parties. Allende's appointed army chief, Augusto Pinochet, rose to supreme power within a year of the coup, formally assuming power in late-1974. The United States government, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup, promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power. During the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup, Allende gave his final speech, in which he vowed to stay in the presidential palace, refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation. Direct witness accounts of Allende's death agree that he killed himself in the palace. Before the coup, Chile had been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability for decades; whilst the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and Caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932."

Ashbrook of Ohio defeated Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia. Rockefeller’s two challengers from the 1972 primary, John Ashbrook and Pete McCloskey, met again, this time running neck and neck throughout most of the primary until Ashbrook won an upset victory in California. The national convention was deeply divided between liberals and conservatives. Ashbrook was only nominated when he agreed that McCloskey would be his running mate. The Democrats nominated the little-known Jimmy Carter, former Governor of Georgia. Carter was a moderate and presented himself as a political outsider, exactly what the Democratic Party needed to “reinvent” itself after the defeats of ‘68 and ‘72. The campaign was tense and the issues of the Cold War dominated the campaign. Ashbrook attempted to stir up another “red scare” in the US, citing the recent overthrow of pro-western governments in Cambodia and Ethiopia, the death of Franco in Spain, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal and the wars left in its wake. He succeeded in portraying Carter as a non-interventionist liberal who would isolate the U.S. from its allies. The rise of conservatism in recent decades also aided Ashbrook in his campaign. On election night Ashbrook won in a landslide, sweeping the west coast, Midwest and Northeast while Carter only managed to hold Democratic strongholds in the South."

The seven-day official visit to three Chinese cities was the first time a U.S. president had visited the PRC; Kennedy's arrival in Beijing ended 19 years of no communication or diplomatic ties between the two countries and was the key step in normalizing relations between the U.S. and China. Kennedy visited China to gain more leverage over relations with the Soviet Union. The week-long visit, from February 21 to 28, 1966, allowed the American public to view images of China for the first time in two decades. Throughout the week the President and his senior advisers engaged in substantive discussions with the PRC leadership, including a meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, while First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy toured schools, factories and hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Hangzhou and Shanghai with the large American press corps in tow. Kennedy dubbed his visit "the week that changed the world", a descriptor that continues to echo in the political lexicon. Repercussions of the Kennedy visit continue to this day; while near-immediate results included a significant shift in the Cold War balance - driving a wedge between the Soviet Union and China - the trip spawned China's opening to the world and eventual transition to democracy."

China had gone through rapid economic development and social changes after the death of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party faced a crisis of legitimacy due to growing dissatisfaction among both the populace and the intellectual elite. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy and restrictions on political participation. The uprising began as student protests that were violently suppressed by riot police. The event sparked a growing series of demonstrations that quickly turned into an anti-communist uprising. The Communist Party was divided and indecisive. Deng favored a harsh crackdown while many of his liberal proteges that now occupied posts in the government wanted to give concessions to the protestors. Premier Zhao Ziyang used the protests as leverage against the old guard and had many of Deng’s allies removed from power. After convincing General Secretary Hu Yaobang to introduce extensive reforms, Zhao addressed the protestors at Tiananmen Square on June 4th, where he applauded their courage and determination. The following day General Secretary Hu Yaobang announced that the CPC would give up their monopoly on power and allow opposition leaders into the National People’s Congress. Then he resigned and was replaced by Zhao, who brought democratic activists into the government and began to draft a new constitution for China."

Relations between the UAR and Israel had not been normalized since the Suez Crisis and tensions remained high due to the continuing Israeli occupation of the Sinai. These tensions were exasperated in early 1964 due to Israeli reprisal attacks against Palestinians. President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the UAR called for an end to the violence and sent an ultimatum to Israel while blockading the Straits of Tiran. Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel ignored the ultimatum and on February 5th the UAR, Jordan and Lebanon declared war on Israel. Despite early successes the Egyptian army was beaten back after six days of fighting and Israel crossed the Suez Canal. In the east Israel defeated both the Jordanian and Syrian forces, pushing them out of the West Bank and the Golan Heights. The United States feared Soviet involvement in the conflict and thus kept a close military presence in the eastern Mediterranean. After a failed Lebanese attack on the USS Liberty, the U.S. began a limited bombing campaign while Israel pushed into southern Lebanon. All countries in the Arab coalition agreed to a ceasefire in the second week, by that point Israel had begun shelling the outskirts of Cairo. Israel successfully occupied the West Bank, the Golan Heights and Southern Lebanon and withdrew to the eastern bank of the Suez Canal.

On May 1st the chairmen of all republics met in Almaty where the declaration denouncing the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR was drafted. It was signed by all attending delegates and on that day the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist. The union was replaced by a small inter-governmental organization, which would soon be dissolved as well. This was condemned by the remnants of the Soviet government, but they lacked the power to dispute the declaration. A week later Romanov was forced to dissolve his government and resign as General Secretary.

Russia experienced a great deal of instability during the first months of independence. The legal status of everything from property and industry to borders were not well established. Ryzhkov chose to open the borders to former republics and aimed to strengthen the economic ties between them. Not everyone agreed and many republics were quickly descending into economic recession. Meanwhile the liberalization brought by Gorbachev and Ryzhkov led to increasing demands for democratic elections. Facing continued demonstrations the chairman called for elections to take place by the end of the year. The process can only be described as chaotic. More than 20 new parties participated in the election, fielding hundreds of previously unknown candidates. Nikolay Travkin, a little known politician turned populist launched the Constitutional Democratic Party, aimed at restoring civil liberties and initiating Russia’s transition into a market economy. The CPSU struggled with internal issues between reformists and hardliners which prompted a faction of the party to break off and form a new Communist Party. Due to unrest and vote splitting the so called “Cadet Party” secured a plurality of the popular vote and became the foremost political force in the Russian Supreme Soviet, even surpassing the CPSU.

Moderates and reformists in the CPSU were also swept up in investigations and trials, eventually even liberal opponents of Travkin found themselves targeted.
