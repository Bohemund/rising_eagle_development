 decision_event.1.d:0 "The United States presidential election of 1952 was the 42nd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won a close victory over sitting Democratic President Harry S. Truman, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932. The incumbent President entered the primaries with moderate support but was challenged by populist Senator Estes Kefauver. Truman received a huge surge in support on the fourth of July when the Korean Peace Agreement was signed, signaling an American victory in the Korean War. The President rallied the party to his side and was nominated on the first ballot of the national convention, alongside his hand-picked running mate; Southern Democrat John Sparkman. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Governor Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the 1952 national convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young anti-Communist Senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate. Eisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, "I Like Ike." In one of the closest elections in modern history Eisenhower managed to beat Truman by a small margin in both the popular and electoral vote, despite the latter’s image as the victor of both the Korean War and World War II."

 decision_event.2.d:0 "The Korean Peace Agreement was the unconditional surrender of all forces belonging to the proclaimed Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on July 4th, 1952. In the weeks preceding, a small remaining number of North Korean forces were isolated within the northeastern tip of Korea, notably after the fall of Kanggye to Allied forces. At Hyesan the last remaining North Korean commanders and politicians waited and held the ground so that troops could be evacuated across the Yalu River into the People’s Republic of China. On the third of July General Mark Clark's troops surrounded the city, and the following day acting President Kim Tu-bong signed an agreement that formally terminated all remaining DPRK forces on the Korean peninsula and officially put the entire region under the control of the Republic of Korea, though they were already recognized as the legitimate Korean government by most of the UN. The “surrender at Hyesan” was not just a victory in conflict for America, but also a major propaganda success, with the image of victorious Allied soldiers being spread far and wide across the world. America had won its first victory against their new enemy, Communism."

 decision_event.3.d:0 "The 1953 Iranian coup D'état was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States. Mossadegh had sought to audit the documents of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a British corporation and to limit the company's control over Iranian petroleum reserves. Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country. After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built Abadan oil refinery, then the world's largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government. Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran's government, though the predecessor Truman administration had opposed a coup, fearing the precedent that CIA involvement would set. Following the coup in 1953, a government under General Fazlollah Zahedi was formed which allowed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to rule more firmly as monarch."

 decision_event.4.d:0 "The 1954 Guatemalan coup D'état was a covert operation carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions about the extent of communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Arbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Arbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador. Described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, and contributed to long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America."

 decision_event.9.d:0 "The Suez Crisis was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aim of the invasion was to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalized the canal. The invasion began on October 29th, to which Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. In response the two western powers landed troops along the Suez Canal on November 5th. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they blocked the canal to all shipping. The three allies had attained a number of their military objectives, but the canal was useless. Heavy political pressure from the United States and the USSR led to a withdrawal. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had strongly warned Britain not to invade; he threatened serious damage to the British financial system by selling the US government's pound sterling bonds. Israel fulfilled some of its objectives, such as attaining freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran, which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Despite this success the invasion was a decisive diplomatic victory for Nasser, who secured support from the Soviet Union while strengthening his position as President of Egypt."

The incumbent President, Republican Dwight Eisenhower successfully ran for re-election. Eisenhower, who had first become famous for his military leadership in World War II, had become far more popular than expected due to his successful, tough stance on Communism. He was unopposed in the primaries and had a broad national following even greater than his first election campaign. The populist Senator Estes Kefauver defeated Adlai Stevenson, Governor William Averell Harriman and other candidates to seize the Democratic Party's nomination, despite lacking the support of the Democratic establishment. Kefauver campaigned on his time in the senate and his investigation into government corruption, as well as appealing to the legacy of Roosevelt, calling for a significant increase in government spending on social programs and warning that more years under a Republican administration could lead to a second Great Depression. In the end, Kefauver's attempt at recreating the “New Deal” populist movement of the 1930’s was ineffective against the sheer popularity and likeableness of Eisenhower, handing a second term to the President on election night. The incumbent maintained support with Republicans and made significant gains among Democrats, especially white urban Southerners and Northern Catholics."

 decision_event.6.d:0 "The Civil Rights Movement was a decades-long movement with the goal of securing legal rights for African Americans that other Americans already held. Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection of all Americans. Moderates in the movement worked with Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation overturning discriminatory practices. President Kennedy's Civil Rights Act of 1963 expressly banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices; ended unequal application of voter registration requirements; and prohibited racial segregation in schools, at the workplace, and in public accommodations. Successive legislation rapidly ended legal inequality in the United States, most notably during the Kennedy Presidency and his successor Nelson Rockefeller's first years. From 1962 through 1971, a wave of inner-city riots in black communities undercut support from the white middle class, but increased support from private foundations. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from about 1963 to 1982, challenged the established black leadership for its cooperative attitude and its practice of nonviolence, and instead demanding that, in addition to the new laws gained through the nonviolent movement, political and economic self-sufficiency be built in the black community. Charismatic universally recognised leader of the civil rights movement Martin Luther King played a significant role in inspiring millions around the nation, and his assassination attempt is seen as the final blow against pro-segregation movements."

In a closely contested election, Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican Vice President Richard Nixon. This was the first election in which all fifty states participated and the first in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for another term. Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower. Kennedy on the other hand battled against a range of adversaries. Most notably the experienced Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who Kennedy would ask to serve has his running mate. The issue of the Cold War dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kennedy safely seized the highest number of electoral college votes, beating Nixon by over 100 electorates. The popular vote however was one of the closest in recent history, the difference between both candidates being less than one percent."

In response to a failed counterrevolutionary coup in Havana, sponsored by the United States and Haiti, Soviet leader Georgy Malenkov agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during telephone calls between Malenkov and Fidel Castro in March 1961 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that Summer. President Kennedy ordered the US Navy to establish a blockade and announced to a White House press conference that the United States would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba. Demands were subsequently made that the remaining missiles be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union. After a long period of tense negotiations an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Malenkov. On August 11, 1961, the Soviet Union agreed to dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, in turn the United States agreed that it would dismantle their missiles in Italy and Turkey. The crisis remains a high point of tension in the Cold War but the subsequent de-escalation is often attributed to Kennedy’s determination to achieve peace in Cuba."

The initiative supported an annual increase in per capita income, the elimination of adult illiteracy, the establishment of democratic governments, efficient economic planning. It required the participating countries to draw up comprehensive plans for national development and pledge large amounts of capital investment to the program. The alliance charter also included a clause encouraged by US policy makers that committed Latin American governments to the promotion "of conditions that will encourage the flow of foreign investments" to the region. Because of the program, economic assistance to Latin America nearly tripled between fiscal year 1960 and 1961. Between 1962 and 1967 the US supplied billions of dollars of investments to Latin America. However, the amount of aid did not equal the net transfer of resources and development as Latin American countries still had to pay off their debt to the US and other first world countries. Additionally, profits from the investments usually returned to the US, with profits frequently exceeding new investment. The alliance achieved short-term success but economic aid and investment dropped sharply when Nelson Rockefeller entered the White House, and by the early 1970s the program was widely viewed as a failure."

The following day, with the military already in control of the country, the Brazilian Congress came out in support of the coup and endorsed it by declaring vacant the office of the presidency. The coup put an end to the government of Goulart, a member of the Brazilian Labour Party. President Jânio Quadros resigned in 1961 and was succeeded by Vice President Goulart. He took office with full powers, and during his rule several problems in Brazilian politics became evident, as well as disputes in the context of the Cold War, which helped destabilize his government. Goulart’s proposed Basic Reforms Plan had the potential to socialize the profits of large companies to ensure a better quality of life for most Brazilians, but was labelled as a "socialist threat" by right-wing sectors of society and of the military, which organized major demonstrations against the government. The coup brought to Brazil a military regime politically aligned to the interests of the United States government. This regime lasted until 1991, when it was replaced by the new government of the South American Union."

Lucien Conein, the Central Intelligence Agency's liaison between the U.S. Embassy and the coup planners, told them that the U.S. would not intervene to stop it. Conein also provided funds to the coup leaders. The coup was led by General Duong Van Minh and started on 1 November. It proceeded smoothly as many loyalist leaders were captured after being caught off-guard and casualties were light. Diem was captured and executed the next day along with his brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu. Following the coup General Minh took power and formed the Military Revolutionary Council, with former Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho serving as a figurehead president."

Incumbent Democratic President John F. Kennedy defeated William Scranton the Republican nominee. Kennedy easily defeated segregationist Governor George Wallace of Alabama in the primary before being nominated at the national convention. In one of the most contested Republican primaries in recent memory Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania defeated conservative Senator Barry Goldwater. Scranton entered the race late after Nelson Rockefeller’s campaign had lost steam. He had to fight tooth and nail at the convention to win over delegates, arguing that Goldwater’s conservatism made him unelectable by a majority of the country. Kennedy championed his passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1963, and his campaign continued to advocate for his anti-poverty programs collectively known as the “New Frontier.” Scranton campaigned on his principal issue of education reform, aiming to use his experience as governor of Pennsylvania to implement similar reforms across the country. With Kennedy’s massive popularity the Democrats managed to hold their ground and even gain many states. This was the first presidential election after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1963, which had led to mass enfranchisement of racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. The election defeated many conservative Republican congressmen, giving Kennedy a majority that could overcome the conservative coalition which had hindered many reforms during his first term."

The slogan eventually developed into a label for his administration's domestic and foreign programs. The main goal was the total elimination of poverty and racial injustice, the expansion of education and the establishment of a space program to rival that of the Soviet Union. The Kennedy administration launched new major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation. The program and its initiatives were subsequently promoted by him and fellow Democrats in Congress in the 1960s and years following. The New Frontier in scope and sweep resembled the New Deal domestic agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Kennedy was greatly aided by Vice President Johnson, who had created large parts of the program. After the Democratic sweep of the House and Senate in 1964 the program could be implemented with more certainty but many anti-war Democrats complained that spending on the Vietnam War choked off the New Frontier. The programs continued to expand under the subsequent Rockefeller administration and eventually also under his brother Ted Kennedy."

One of the most tumultuous periods in the country's modern history, it was the commencement of Suharto's 34-year presidency. Sukarno drew power from balancing the opposing and increasingly antagonistic forces of the army and Indonesian Communist Party. By 1965, the Communists extensively penetrated all levels of government and gained influence at the expense of the army. On 30 September 1965, six of the military's most senior officers were killed in an action by the so-called 30 September Movement, a communist group from within the armed forces. Within a few hours, Major General Suharto mobilised forces under his command and took control of Jakarta. Anti-communists, initially following the army's lead, went on a violent purge of communists throughout the country, killing an estimated half million people and destroying the Communist Party, which was officially blamed for the crisis. The politically weakened Sukarno was forced to transfer key political and military powers to General Suharto, who had become head of the armed forces. In March 1967, the Indonesian parliament named General Suharto acting president. He was formally appointed president one year later. Sukarno lived under virtual house arrest until his death in 1970. In contrast to the stormy nationalism, revolutionary rhetoric, and economic failure that characterised the early 1960s under the left-leaning Sukarno, Suharto's pro-Western "New Order" stabilised the economy but continued the policies of Pancasila."

The offensive was countrywide and well coordinated, taking the South Vietnamese army by surprise. Attempts by the south to regroup were largely unsuccessful and by August the South Vietnamese army had collapsed on all fronts except the Mekong Delta. Saigon was surrounded by northern troops who began a shelling of the city, destroying the airport and trapping the civilians trying to escape. Though President Kennedy had largely withdrawn all U.S. advisors and military personnel in 1965 a small force remained to protect the American embassy and any remaining U.S. citizens. This force began Operation Fall, evacuating all remaining personnel and thousands of civilians associated with the southern regime. On September 23rd the North Vietnamese army occupied the city and raised their flag over the presidential palace, naming the city Ho Chí Minh City, after the North Vietnamese president Ho Chí Minh.

He gained support and material from America on the orders of President Nelson Rockefeller, who wanted to prevent the spread of communism in southeast Asia after the fall of Saigon in 1968. On the 11th of April while Norodom was on a diplomatic mission to Beijing, the Cambodian military surrounded the National Assembly which unilaterally voted to remove Norodom as Head of State. Emergency powers were subsequently invoked by Prime Minister Lon Nol, who became effective head of state, and led ultimately to the proclamation of the Khmer Republic later that year.

They took control of the government by arresting President Celal Bayar and cabinet members, the army by forcing 235 generals and 3500 officers into early retirement, the justice system by detaining 520 judges. It was orchestrated by Alparslan Türkeş and eventually led by Cemal Gürsel against the Democrat Party. The incident was caused by years of socio-economic hardship. Colonel Alparslan Türkeş stated his allegiance to NATO in his address to the nation, Türkeş declared the coup over radio, which ultimately announced “the end of one period in Turkish history, and usher in a new one”. The following trials resulted in the execution of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Minister of Finance Hasan Polatkan and the imprisonment of President Celal Bayar because of old age. A new constitution was written to replace the old one from 1924, it was approved by 61.7% percent of the votes.

 decision_event.23.d:0 "The Mexican general election of 2000 was the 18th election to be held in Mexico since the Revolution of 1917. It was held on Sunday, July 2, 2000, and was held to announce the new President of the Republic to serve a six-year term. Due to Mexican rules on term limits, the previous president, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, could not run in the election, and so the Institutional Revolutionary Party chose Mexican economist Francisco Labastida to take up the banner of the PRI and ensure the dominance of the party for 6 more years. Due to the rejuvenated Synarchist movement, fuelled by continued American influence in Mexican politics and growing nationalism and populism, the Social Democrats attempted to forge a coalition with the Synarchists against the political establishment. This “Alliance for Mexico” was made up of the PRD, the Labor Party, the Party of the Nationalist Society, and the National Synarchist Party, an anti-establishment pact that united both the left and right against the PRI and the PAN. With nationalists and PRI dissidents being attracted by this new coalition, the PAN and PRI began to lose numbers in the polls to the Alliance for Mexico, and the ability of a non-PRI party to win the election became more and more possible. Vicente Fox, the candidate of the National Action Party, was attacked for his views on American foreign policy and his neoliberal economic policies. The opposition slandered him as an American puppet who would bring the country into NATO, and would strengthen the already-powerful American businesses currently acting in Mexico. The polls leading up to the election were divisive - and the election appeared to be going anyone’s way, but eventually, the PRI kept its 83-year hold over the Mexican political system by a margin of 1 million votes, and Francisco Labastida became the 18th president of Mexico."

 decision_event.24.d:0 "The 1973 Chilean coup d'état was a watershed moment in both the history of Chile and the Cold War. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the opposition-controlled Congress of Chile and the socialist President Salvador Allende, as well as economic warfare ordered by US President Nelson Rockefeller, Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police. The military deposed Allende's Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially the Communist and socialist parties. Allende's appointed army chief, Augusto Pinochet, rose to supreme power within a year of the coup, formally assuming power in late-1974. The United States government, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup, promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power. During the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup, Allende gave his final speech, in which he vowed to stay in the presidential palace, refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation. Direct witness accounts of Allende's death agree that he killed himself in the palace. Before the coup, Chile had been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability for decades; whilst the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and Caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932."

Ashbrook of Ohio defeated Jimmy Carter of Georgia. Rockefeller’s two challengers from the ‘72 primary met again, this time running neck and neck throughout most of the primary until Ashbrook won an upset victory in California. The convention was deeply divided between liberals and conservatives, but eventually Ashbrook was nominated on the fifth ballot. In a surprising move Ashbrook offered the spot of Vice President to McCloskey, who accepted after a long time of deliberation. The Democrats nominated the little-known Jimmy Carter, former Governor of Georgia. Carter was a moderate and presented himself as a political outsider, exactly what the Democratic Party needed to “reinvent” itself after the defeats of ‘68 and ‘72.\n\nThe campaign was tense, the issue of the Vietnam War was still fresh in the minds of the people and Ashbrook criticized President Rockefeller for his withdrawal. He also called for further aid to the government of Taiwan and to the rebellion that broke out that spring in China. His tough stance on communism was popular, but his very conservative social policies were often criticized by Carter and other liberals. On election night Ashbrook secured a confident majority of electors, sweeping the West Coast and winning most of the Midwest and the South, which was expected to go for Carter."

 decision_event.26.d:0 "U.S. President John F. Kennedy's 1966 visit to the People's Republic of China was an important strategic and diplomatic overture that marked the culmination of the Kennedy administration's resumption of harmonious relations between the United States and mainland China after years of diplomatic isolation. The seven-day official visit to three Chinese cities was the first time a U.S. president had visited the PRC; Kennedy's arrival in Beijing ended 19 years of no communication or diplomatic ties between the two countries and was the key step in normalizing relations between the U.S. and China. Kennedy visited China to gain more leverage over relations with the Soviet Union. The week-long visit, from February 21 to 28, 1966, allowed the American public to view images of China for the first time in over two decades. Throughout the week the President and his senior advisers engaged in substantive discussions with the PRC leadership, including a meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, while First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy toured schools, factories and hospitals in the cities of Beijing, Hangzhou and Shanghai with the large American press corps in tow. Kennedy dubbed his visit "the week that changed the world", a descriptor that continues to echo in the political lexicon. Repercussions of the Kennedy visit continue to this day; while near-immediate results included a significant shift in the Cold War balance - driving a wedge between the Soviet Union and China - the trip spawned China's opening to the world and eventual transition to democracy."

 decision_event.27.d:0 "The White Flower Revolution was a popular uprising against the government of the People’s Republic of China that started on the 4th of June, 1976. It began as a coup by reformists inside the Chinese Communist Party who attempted to oust Premier Peng Dehuai and Chairman Zhu De. The coup was faced with stiff resistance but forces loyal to the Premier were unable to suppress the putschists and the incident turned into an all-out battle in Beijing. The Soviet Union began to fund the rebels, in an effort to weaken their main communist rival and install a government more accepting of Soviet leadership. Forces would be brought in from South China in order to deal with the rebellion. Peng once again accused the United States and the Republic of China of funding the rebels and denounced them in a spectacular speech, which led to China severing all diplomatic ties with both nations. President Chiang Ching-kuo saw this as an attempt to violate the unofficial armistice that had existed since 50’s and prepared the country for war. The Kuomintang launched an invasion of South China in early August, shortly after the Yangtze Revolt began. Uprisings in major cities led to the People’s Liberation Army being pushed back. The rebels united as the National Democratic Army, bolstered by significant aid from the US. The PLA, assailed from many fronts and pressured by defections eventually collapsed and Premier Peng surrendered to the rebel forces. The revolution claimed an estimated 20 million lives and inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on China. The revolution and the Chinese Civil War officially ended when the reformists, now known as the Chinese Socialist Front, the National Democratic Army and the Kuomintang formed a coalition government and Deng Xiaoping was inaugurated as president of the Provisional Authority of the Republic of China."

Relations between Egypt and Israel had not been normalized since the Suez Crisis and tensions remained high due to the continuing Israeli occupation of the Sinai. Ali Sabri, the socialist president of Egypt sought help from the USSR to train and equip the Egyptian army. On the 5th of February the Egyptian army launched attacks across the canal while naval forces retook Sharm el-Sheikh in the Red Sea. Despite early successes the Egyptian army was beaten back after six days of fighting and Israel in turn crossed the canal. In the east Israel defeated both the Jordanian and Syrian forces, pushing them out of the West Bank and the Golan Heights. The United States feared Soviet involvement in the conflict and thus kept a close military presence in the eastern Mediterranean. On the seventh day the Lebanese Air Force launched an unsuccessful attack on the USS Liberty, prompting the US enter the war. American forces began a bombing campaign over Beirut while Israel pushed into southern Lebanon. All countries in the Arab coalition agreed to a ceasefire in the second week, by that point Israel had begun shelling the outskirts of Cairo. Israel successfully occupied the West Bank, the Golan Heights and Southern Lebanon in exchange for withdrawal to the western bank of the Suez Canal. Egypt regained control of the Straits of Tiran but they were forced to guarantee Israeli shipping through the area. As a result of the war thousands of Palestinians would flee the Israeli occupation, while Jewish communities fled or were expelled by Arab nations."

Following the secession of the Baltic Republics Grigory Romanov’s hold on power was greatly weakened. The regional governments were effectively operating independently without the General Secretary’s authority. Russian President Nikolai Ryzhkov condemned Romanov’s coup against the Politburo and Romanov in turn denounced him and demanded his arrest. As the army command was divided on who to support fighting broke out in Moscow when both sides attempted occupy Red Square. In response to this Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev called a meeting of the constituent leaders of all republics in the Soviet Union. The republics were scrambling to pull free from the union, like the Baltics had already done. On May 1st the presidents of all republics met in Almaty where the declaration denouncing the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR was drafted. It was signed by all attending delegates and on that day the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist. The union was replaced by a small inter-governmental organization, which would soon be dissolved as well. This was condemned by the remnants of the Soviet government but they lacked the power to dispute the declaration. A week later Romanov was forced to dissolve his government and resign as General Secretary. Together with many Soviet politicians Romanov would move to Karakalpakstan, the only republic which did not recognize the declaration."

It was held on Sunday, November 17th on the anniversary of the October Revolution. Nikolay Travkin of the newly established Constitutional Democratic Party defeated the incumbent Nikolai Ryzhkov of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Russia experienced a great deal of instability during the first months of independence. The legal status of everything from property and industry to borders were not well established. Ryzhkov chose to open the borders to former republics and aimed to strengthen the economic ties between them. Not everyone agreed and many republics were quickly descending into economic recession. Meanwhile the liberalization brought by Gorbachev and Ryzhkov led to increasing demands for democratic elections. Facing continued demonstrations the president called for elections to take place by the end of the year. The process can only be described as chaotic. Many hopefuls put forth their candidacy but only a few were supported by the established parties. Nikolay Travkin, a little known politician turned populist launched the Constitutional Democratic Party, aimed at restoring civil liberties and initiating Russia’s transition into a market economy. The Communist Party struggled with internal issues between reformists and hardliners, which prompted a faction of the party to support Oleg Shenin’s independent candidacy. Faced with unrest and vote splitting Travkin secured a plurality of the popular vote and was voted in as the second president of Russia. Subsequent legislative elections would establish the so called “Cadet Party” as the foremost political force in the Russian Supreme Soviet."

With his party having secured a strong mandate in the legislative election the previous year, the president began the process of trying and convicting supporters of Romanov’s coup. Former Minister of Defence Dmitry Yazov was the first in a long list of “putschists” to be tried, ending in December with Grigory Romanov himself being tried in-absentia. During the trials many more politicians and ministers found themselves to be targets of a wider campaign, aimed at removing communist influence in the government and discrediting the CPSU. Travkin presented these efforts as necessary to protect Russia against another coup by communist hardliners, but they were not alone in being targeted. Moderates and reformists in the CPSU were also swept up in investigations and trials, eventually even liberal opponents of Travkin found themselves targeted. The trials - which were likened to purges by foreign media - only stopped in April the following year, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was banned by the Ministry of Justice."

After independence Azerbaijan was ruled by Kamran Baghirov, the former communist First Secretary of Azerbaijan. His regime was reluctant in implementing democratic reforms and instead sought to win support through nationalist rhetoric. This was not enough to placate the population, who desired increased freedoms and an end to the state-atheist system maintained during the Soviet era. Influenced by the ideas of the Iranian Revolution, a new generation of liberal and Islamist parties rose to prominence and began to campaign against the government. What initially began as small student protests eventually became a large-scale campaign of public demonstrations. The movement swept through Azerbaijan and forced the president to leave the presidential palace. A day later on May 16th a coalition of Islamists and liberals secured power and Haji Alikram was sworn in as provisional president of Azerbaijan."

Two years earlier Francisco Franco, the long-time dictator of Spain had died and King Juan Carlos had been crowned as the King of Spain. Juan Carlos had shown an interest in reforming the Francoist state and introducing democracy in the country. Ashbrook was weary of a leftist takeover in Spain as had happened in Portugal the previous year. Despite deteriorating relations between the US and Spain, Ashbrook went on a personal mission to meet both the new king and prime minister Manuel Fraga. In late September he arrived in Madrid and spent three days with King Juan Carlos, enjoying the luxuries afforded to the royal family and discussing the future of Spain. Ashbrook even floated the idea of a possible Spanish entry into NATO, something the king did not decline. On the fourth day he was finally able to meet with Manuel Fraga, who had just returned from Barcelona. The two met and it was reported that Ashbrook was impressed with the new Prime Minister, saying he was able, experienced and most importantly a staunch anti-communist. After the meeting the two leaders travelled together on a motorcade towards the Madrid-Barajas Airport when a van exploded right beside their car. The explosion was orchestrated by Spanish marxists and led to the death of both leaders. Vice President Pete McCloskey was sworn in as president as soon as news reached the cabinet in Washington."

The movement against the United States-backed monarchy was supported by various leftist and Islamist organizations and student movements. Demonstrations against the Shah commenced in October 1977, developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included both secular and religious elements, and which intensified in January 1978. Between August and December 1978, strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country. The Shah left Iran for exile on the 16th of January 1979, as the last Persian monarch, leaving his duties to a regency council and Shapour Bakhtiar who was an opposition-based prime minister. Ayatollah Khomeini was invited back to Iran by the government, and returned to Tehran to a greeting by several million Iranians. The royal reign collapsed shortly after on February 11th when guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting, bringing Khomeini to official power. Iran voted by national referendum to become an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979 and to formulate and approve a new constitution whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country in December 1979."

Democratic nominee Ted Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican President Pete McCloskey. McCloskey's poor relations with Republican leaders encouraged an intra-party challenge by Ronald Reagan, former actor and Governor of California. McCloskey defeated Reagan in the majority of the Republican primaries, but Reagan remained in the race until McCloskey was officially nominated at the national convention. Reagan then re-entered the race as an independent candidate, campaigning for increased defense spending, supply-side economics and a balanced budget. The Democratic primaries were contested between Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, Governor Jerry Brown of California, Congressman and former astronaut John Glenn of Ohio, and several other candidates. All of Kennedy's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries, and the national convention nominated a ticket consisting of Kennedy and Glenn. Kennedy campaigned for interventionist economic policies, social justice and better relations with the Soviet Union with an emphasis on denuclearization. His campaign was aided by Republican dissatisfaction with McCloskey and the Iran Hostage Crisis. Kennedy won the election in a landslide, taking a large majority of the electoral vote and over half of the popular vote. Simultaneously the Democrats increased their majority in both the Senate and Congress, paving the way for Kennedy’s many reforms."

Shevardnadze’s fourteen year-rule had been characterized by large scale anti-corruption campaigns and economic reform. By 1986, Shevardnadze’s clique of loyalists had become so entrenched in the government that corruption and nepotism was once again rampant. The military was dissatisfied with the president’s decision to withdraw from Adjara and Abkhazia, two breakaway republics in western Georgia. They turned to Tengiz Kitovani, a previously unknown commander-turned-warlord who with the help of paramilitaries and the Georgian Armed Forces had carved out his own realm on the Abkhaz border. Together the Georgian army and the rebel militias took control of Tbilisi on Christmas Eve of 1986 and President Shevardnadze was ousted.

Manuel Fraga had grown deeply unpopular since his election only a few months earlier. Despite his best efforts further reform had been halted by the legislature. He was opposed by both the Francoist-dominated Senate and the liberal, reform-minded Congress of Deputies. As time passed, legislative deadlock ensued. The Senate would not pass any new laws or reforms that threatened the power of the Francoist state, while the Chamber rejected proposals on the grounds that they were too reactionary. Popular discontent increased and radicalism grew across the country, especially in historically separatist areas. Fraga tried to quell the tensions by visiting Barcelona, but he was only met by protests. After a harsh crackdown by the Civil Guard, Fraga returned to Madrid in order to meet with U.S. President John M. Ashbrook. The president openly admitted that the United States government was sceptical of Spain transitioning to democracy but promised that Fraga and his government would have their support in the event of a communist uprising.
