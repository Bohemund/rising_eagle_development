 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_NZANGA_MOBUTU_DESC:0 "Nzanga Mobutu is the son of President Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled Zaire with an iron fist from 1965 until his death in 1997. He studied in Western Europe and Canada before returning to Zaire and serving as an advisor to his father at the onset of the Congo War. In 1996 the Tutsi-dominated government of Rwanda invaded Zaire alongside Uganda and Burundi. The alliance occupied large parts of eastern Zaire by the end of the year and hinted that their goal was to topple Mobutu’s government altogether. But poor infrastructure made large advances difficult and in 1997 the Angolan government under Jonas Savimbi intervened in Mobutu’s favor, providing much needed relief to the Zairean forces. That same year Mobutu Sese Seko died and Nzanga Mobutu succeeded his father as president of Zaire. With support from Angola and Sudan, the Zairan forces prevented any further advance by the Tutsi alliance, which slowly broke down due to internal conflicts. By 1999 the Rwandan and Ugandan forces had withdrawn, leaving eastern Zaire controlled by Marxist rebel groups. Since then Zaire has been in a fragile position. Corruption permeates the government and the state is heavily in debt while the presidential family grows richer. Nzanga Mobutu has opened the country up to slight reform, beginning negotiations with rebel groups and forging a political alliance with liberal parties. But every presidential election has been fraudulent and the government remains one of the most kleptocratic and repressive states on the continent."
