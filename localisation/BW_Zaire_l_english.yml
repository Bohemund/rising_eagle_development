 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_NZANGA_MOBUTU_DESC:0 "Nzanga Mobutu is the son of Mobutu Sese Seko, who became president of the Congo after leading a military coup in 1965. He led the nation he named Zaire for three decades, establishing a kleptocratic, totalitarian one-party state. Mobutu had long groomed his oldest son, Ayiwa Mobutu, to be his successor. This was not to be, as Ayiwa died in 1994 and Mobutu was forced to turn to his second son, Nzanga Mobutu. Nzanga had spent most of his adult life studying in the West and returned to Zaire at the onset of the Great African War in 1996, when the Tutsi-dominated government of Rwanda invaded Zaire alongside Uganda and Burundi. The alliance pushed through eastern Zaire and occupied large parts of the country, meanwhile Mobutu’s health was failing and he was unable to coordinate any effective resistance to the invaders. The country was saved from certain disaster by Angola, who intervened in Mobutu’s favor, providing much needed relief to the Zairean forces. Less than a year later Mobutu Sese Seko died after a long battle with cancer and was succeeded by his son, Nzanga Mobutu. With support from Angola and Sudan, the Zairan forces prevented any further advance by the Rwandan alliance, which slowly broke down due to internal issues. By 1999 the alliance forces had withdrawn, leaving eastern Zaire controlled by Tutsi rebel groups and the Marxist militias of Laurent-Désiré Kabila. Since then the country has remained in a tenuous position. Though Nzanga has continued the reforms initiated by his father in 1990, the country is still plagued by corruption, lawlessness and rebel movements."
