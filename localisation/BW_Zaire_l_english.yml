 #LEADERS
 POLITICS_NZANGA_MOBUTU_DESC:0 "Nzanga Mobutu is the son of President Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled Zaire with an iron fist from 1965 until his death in 1997. The younger Mobutu was educated in western institutions before returning to Zaire at the onset of the Congo War. In 1996 the Tutsi-dominated government of Rwanda invaded Zaire alongside Uganda and Burundi. The alliance had occupied large parts of eastern Zaire by the end of the year and hinted that their goal was to topple Mobutu’s government altogether. But poor infrastructure made large advances difficult and by 1997 the Angolan government under Jonas Savimbi had intervened in Mobutu’s favor, providing much needed relief to the Zairean forces. The same year Nzanga Mobutu succeeded his father as president of Zaire. His administration continued to open up the government and began negotiations with rebel forces supported by Rwanda. He forged a political alliance with liberal parties but despite this the government of Zaire remains repressive and elections remain fraudulent, with Mobutu winning every election since his ascent to the presidency overwhelmingly."
